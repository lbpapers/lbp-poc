<p>TW2020 is a catalyst for Church Planting and a World Without Orphans. TW2020 focuses ensuring the availability of basic needs among the poorest communities in the world in response to the poverty challenge, calling to integrity, purity and witness in Christian marriages and families, fostering families of love, friendship, discipleship and mentorship in response to the challenge of Islam, and promoting justice and human dignity in all the world and by encouraging, building, and connecting houses of prayer in the spirit of the tabernacle of David and strengthen through relationship for individual and corporate transformation in all seven spheres of cultural influence in every region of the world engaging adults, youth and children in this calling.</p>
<p>The mission of Transform World 2020 urgently calls the church to consider the critical challenges of our time. We trust that Godâ€™s people all over the world will respond to each challenge through informed, cohesive, prayerful action leading to a godly, Spirit-led movement in the spheres of cultural influence they operate in and the geographic area in which they live and move and have their being.</p>
