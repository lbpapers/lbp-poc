		<p id="first-paragraph"><strong>Introduction:</strong><br>
On this 14<sup>th</sup> day of the 4<sup>th</sup> month of 2012 God's people around the world have been called to meet the challenge of the 4/14 Window through united fervent, focused, prayer and fasting. So much is at stake. So much is on the table. Let us come to the table together from wherever we are as we join our hearts with God's heart for the children of the world.</p>
		<p><strong>On the table we find the Shewbread from the Word of God</strong></p>

			<li>Ez 8:23-24 "The gracious hand of our God is on everyone who looks to him… So we fasted and petitioned our God about this, and he answered our prayer."</li>
			<li>Mat 18:5 Jesus said: "Whoever receives one such child in my name receives me." Today we receive Jesus as we receive the 1.2 billion children of the 4/14 Window as our call to prayer.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>On the table we find an expectation birthed in the hearts of God's people around the world called the 4/14 Window initiative. Our prayers today for the 4/14 Window focus on these expectations becoming reality.</p>
		<ul>

		</ul>
		<p><strong>On the table we find a battle raging for the children and youth of the 4/14 Window from our World today.</strong></p>
		<p>The greatest battle going on in our day is the battle for the hearts and minds of men and women. The frontline of that battle is the age group (4-14)</p>
		<p>Jesus said the thief comes to steal, to kill, and to destroy I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly.  A priority focus for Jesus and Satan are the children.
It is a Bloody Battlefield today. The 4/14ers of the world are being trafficked as sex slaves, made to fight the wars started by the adults, abandoned to fend for themselves on the streets of the cities, struggling in the midst of extreme poverty, ignored by their own fathers, suffering due to divorce of the parents. In Honduras 70% are raised  by single mothers.</p>
		<p>Lives are being cut off my our own human hands even before they make it out of their mothers' wombs through abortion -- approximately 42 Million around the world every single year. 83% of all abortions are obtained in developing countries and 17% occur in developed countries. We excuse ourselves by calling it therapeutic abortion and then define it to include the loss of</p>
		<p><strong>On the table we find seven basic challenges to maximize their transformational impact</strong></p>
		<ol>

			<li>The Mental / Cognitive Challenge</li>
			<li>The Physical / Health Challenge</li>
			<li>The Economic Challenge</li>
			<li>The Relational Challenge</li>
			<li>The Social Challenge</li>
			<li>The Ministry Challenge</li>
		</ol>
		<p><strong>On the table we find the  future of Christianity</strong></p>
		<ul>
			<li>4/14ers are the heart of the harvest, Wess Stafford</li>
			<li>During this decade or 'window' most children in this demographic group develop their moral foundations and values</li>
			<li>It is crucial that we re-prioritize and re-direct mission efforts toward those in the 4/14 Window.</li>
			<li>We are engaging the next generation of 4/14ers with a view of their transforming the world.</li>
			<li>The ultimate goal - To equip them to become partners with God on His transformational mission of bringing together all things under the headship of Christ (Eph. 1:9-10) with the result that all things on earth are reconciled and aligned to Him (Col. 1:20).</li>
		</ul>
		<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong><br>
		Chuck Colson wrote: The great need of our day is to fuel a movement to equip believers to nurture Christian transformation in minds, lives, relationships, ministries, and spheres of influence around the world. And who should be at the forefront of that movement? The leaders of tomorrow - orthodox believers ages 4-14 firmly rooted in a faith that propels them to be the hands and feet of Christ. … it's more critical than ever to focus our efforts on reaching this generation.</p>
