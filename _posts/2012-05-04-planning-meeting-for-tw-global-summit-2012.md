		<p><strong>For Presenters</strong><br>
If you are not among those who are making a presentation please plan to remain within the time frame allotted. That means in most presentations there are three parts, the presentation, the feedback and the prayer time, each to be assigned the same amount of time. If your session is 30 minutes then your presentation would ten minutes, with ten minutes for feedback and ten minutes for prayer. It would be helpful to bring a Power Point presentation to summarize your ideas. Since your presentation is elaborated in the Prospectus you can make reference to what has been written and highlight your main points.</p>

		<p>Doris and I are traveling this Monday for the Indonesia National Transformation and Transform Connection Indonesia Sphere Facilitators meeting led by Djohan Handoyo and Iman Santoso. On 10th evening we fly to Manado for two gatherings and to do some research of the status of Christianity in the region.  Many of us will be gathering for the World Prayer Assembly on May 14th to the 18th.</p>
		<p>We look forward to seeing you soon.</p>
		<p>Transformation Godâ€™s way begins with a sense of crisis and a calling from God. We come together with anticipation that He will show us the way to respond.</p>
		<p>Yours in Jesus,</p>
