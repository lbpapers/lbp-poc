<h1>The 10/40 Window - What You Can Do</h1>

<p>There are several important ways in which your church or prayer group can become involved in advancing the AD2000 & Beyond Movement and focusing attention on The 10/40 Window. Consider these possibilities:</p>

<h2>Establish an AD2000 Task Force</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Form a task force of individuals who are committed to pray for the evangelization of the world for Christ. Select a name of your group such as "AD2000 Task Force" or "AD2000 Committee."</li>
  <li>Assign responsibilities within the task force, including communication with church and ministry leaders, promotion, leadership of prayer groups, etc.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Select An Unreached People, A Least Evangelized City and Country</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Select one unreached people group to adopt. By adopting the group, recognize that you are committing to pray for their evangelization. For an AD2000 listing of unreached peoples and more information, contact the Adopt-A-People Clearinghouse, P.O. Box 17490, Colorado Springs, CO 80935, (719) 574-7001.</li>
  <li>Join a "Joshua Project 2000" short term missions team to travel to one of the targeted 2000 least evangelized people groups to pray and do research on how to reach that people. For more information, contact the AD2000 & Beyond Movement, 2860 S. Circle Dr., Suite 2112, Colorado Springs, CO 80906, (719) 576-2000. The AD2000 International Office will be closing early in 2001. <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2001-01-05-ad2000-international-office-is-closed.md %}">Click here for more information</a>.</li>
  <li>Select one of the 1000 least evangelized cities. Study the AD2000 Cities Track Listing available from: Urban Leadership Foundation, 127 N. Madison Ave., #20, Pasadena, CA, 91101, (818) 584-3863.</li>
  <li>Select one of the 61 countries in The 10/40 Window to adopt. Detailed information on the countries is available through: The Sentinal Group, P.O. Box 6334, Lynnwood, WA 98036, (206) 672-2989.</li>
  <li>Assign four task forces for these prayer segments: unreached people group, city, country, and The 10/40 Window.</li>
  <li>Initiate a special adoption process or service that will highlight the unreached people group, city, and/or country that you have adopted.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Hold an AD2000 Consultation</h2>

<p>Conduct a consultation with leaders of key ministries within your church or group to set goals from the present to the year 2000 based on the Word of God, the contextual realities of the ministry within the church/group and outside the church/group, and what you expect God to do in and through the church/group by the year 2000. (Include a local and a global focus.) </p>

<h2>Prepare For Praying Through the Window</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Organize a seminar to prepare for Praying Through the Window in October 1995 and October 1997. Materials are available through the Christian Information Network, 11025 Hwy 83, Colorado Springs, CO 80921, (719) 522-1040.</li>
  <li>Coordinate a month of prayer with fasting in October 1995 and October 1997, to pray for spiritual breakthroughs, the outpouring of the Holy Spirit, and the Lordship of Jesus Christ to be established in every people group, every city, and every country in The 10/40 Window. The focus of October 1995 is the 100 Gateway Cities, and the focus for October 1997 is the 2000 least evangelized peoples.</li>
  <li>Send a team to one of the countries in The 10/40 Window for on-site intercessory prayer during a week in October 1995 and October 1997. Coordinate with the Christian Information Network at the above address.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Prepare For Community Wide Efforts</h2>
