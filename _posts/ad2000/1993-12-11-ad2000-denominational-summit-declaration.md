excerpt:  "Less than two years from now, the Global Consultation on World Evangelization by the Year 2000 and Beyond, GCOWE '95, will be held here in Seoul, Korea. It is only fitting that the Korean church, as host to this event projected to bring together Christian leaders form some 200 countries has become one of the pacesetters in the development of national AD2000 strategies."

<h1>AD2000 Denominational Summit Declaration</h1>

<p class="author">Avery Willis Jr.</p>

<h3>We, the attendees of this historic summit meeting,</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Realizing that God is on a mission to redeem a lost world (II Peter 3:9), and that Christ has given us the Great Commission to make disciples of all nations (Matt. 28:18-20);</li>
  <li>Having come here in the prayerful conviction that the Spirit of God is leading His Church at this unique juncture of history; and</li>
  <li>Having heard the reports of denominational initiatives to the year 2000 and beyond, and of resource networks that are cooperating across denominations, churches and organizations to focus on world evangelization, mobilization of united prayer and coordinated efforts
  to reach the unreached;</li>
  <li>Believing that the Holy Spirit has led us to be present at this gathering, and having experienced the unity of the multifaceted body of Christ and the unique corporate gifting that different denominations and organizations bring to that body.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now, being of one mind in our commitment to work together for the evangelization of the world by the year 2000 and beyond, we, as individuals from various denominations, declare our joint commitment to seek a church for every people and the gospel for every person by the year 2000. We urgently call the worldwide Body of Christ to join openly in linking hands, hearts, minds and spirits in this grand cause of Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>Therefore, we declare, that, upon returning to our respective organizations we will encourage others within our denominations and associations to consider the following actions:</p>

<ol>
  <li>To magnify the focus on the people who do not have access to the gospel, the majority of whom live in the area known as the 10/40 Window, without neglecting the mandate for the whole world;</li>
  <li>To call our people to pray, recognizing prayer as the central strategy that is crucial to this endeavor; to encourage our churches to participate in prayer initiatives, such as Praying Through the Window, the Day to Change the World (on June 25, 1994) and the March for Jesus.</li>
  <li>To encourage our churches to participate in the national strategy initiatives that incorporate the various AD 2000 networks where they exist, and encourage the development of national strategy initiatives where they do not exist.</li>
  <li>To seek ways to accelerate the mission thrust of our respective denominations in our work around the world and the recruitment of new missionaries to the unreached.</li>
  <li>To pursue ways to communicate with and mutually support one another in our common task.</li>
  <li>To utilize the various networks and task forces of the AD 2000 Movement, where appropriate.</li>
</ol>

<p>As fellow servants of Christ we seek to join with other Christian communities around the world in accomplishing these goals. We make these commitments for the greater glory of Christ our Savior, and the extension of His Kingdom to the millions who have not yet heard.</p>
