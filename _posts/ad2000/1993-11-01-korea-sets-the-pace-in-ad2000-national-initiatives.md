<h1>KOREA, Host Country For GCOWE ’95, Sets The Pace In AD2000 National Initiatives</h1>

<p class="author">Luis Bush</p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>Less than two years from now, the Global Consultation on World Evangelization by the Year 2000 and Beyond, GCOWE '95, will be held here in Seoul, Korea. It is only fitting that the Korean church, as host to this event projected to bring together Christian leaders form some 200 countries has become one of the pacesetters in the development of national AD2000 strategies.</p>

<p>Korean AD2000 leader Joon Gon Kim reflected the sense of expectation found in the church in Korea when he said, "We are looking forward to seeing historical, unprecedented, monumental, supernatural and global revival to fulfill the Great Commission taking place in this generation." From a person who has organized the first meeting in history of over one million Christians during the Seoul Billy Graham Crusade 1973 and then again two years later at Explo 75, Joon Gon Kim, the Korean Director of Campus Crusade for Christ, has gained the respect of Christian leaders throughout Korea as a man of his word. This was apparent as we met with 50 key Christian leaders from the Korean AD2000 Movement on Monday June 21. All the major denominations and local churches in Korea have expressed their support for the AD2000 Movement , calling it "the Movement of the Twenty-First Century."</p>

<h3>Why Is the AD2000 Vision So Well-Received?</h3>

<p>Chairman Kim says: "The Korean church has the potential, willingness and sense of urgency... Koreans want to be unified... The AD2000 Movement will be beneficial, not only for Korean evangelization but also for world evangelization." Despite the remarkable growth of the Korean church in the seventies and early eighties, in the mind of Korean Christian leaders, it has plateaued. AD2000 has been viewed therefore as a vehicle that can bring revival to the church of Korea, not only to reach the rest of Korea but also the world with the gospel of the kingdom. In fact, they are hopeful that Korea, under God, would become a truly Christian country, and they perceive the AD2000 Movement as making a contribution toward that vision.</p>

<h3>How Is the AD2000 Vision Being Introduced to the Korean Church?</h3>

<p>A fast moving video on the AD2000 vision begins with planet earth spinning on its axis and showing the countries of the world through the clouds followed by the dawning of a new day. The scene then shifts to the crucifixion of Christ, followed by that of the event recorded in Matthew 28 with the words of the Great Commission to his followers to "make disciples of the nations." This was just the introduction of a powerful communication of the AD2000 vision. As the video continues, Dr. Han Kyung Chik, respected Korean leader and Honorary Chairman for the Korean AD2000 Movement (as well as an honorary chairmen of the global AD2000 & Beyond Movement) underscores the cruciality of the hour and the opportunity before the church. He invites Korean Christians to get involved, explaining that the movement involves prayer, evangelism, social transformation and the unity of the church for world evangelization.</p>

<p>The process has worked beyond any expectations. In December 1992, 21 journalists representing the major Christian and secular newspapers of Korea were invited to a press conference during which the AD2000 Movement and vision was introduced. Five large scrap books, each with forty pages filled with news articles of the different activities related to the Movement testify to the spread of the vision.</p>

<p>Four monthly eight-page Korean AD2000 newsletters have already been produced and circulated among 5,000 carefully selected Christian leaders throughout the countr, keeping them informed about AD2000 activities and news on a national and global level. Today it is said that most Korean pastors know about the AD2000 movement.</p>

<p>On December 21st, 1992, 2200 pastors met for a day to hear the explanation and challenge of the AD2000 vision at the beautiful Korean World Mission Center. This is the venue for GCOWE '95, to which 4500 Christian leaders are expected to come from 200 countries. Since then other meetings of pastors and Christian leaders have been held in Chang Won City, (2400) on May 26, 1993, Taegu City (250) on May 25, 1993, Songtan City (174) on April 17, 1993, Yongin city (25) on May 10, 1993 and Chengju City (40) on June 2, 1993 plus six other cities. Their goal is to share the vision with Christian leaders in the 250 largest cities and towns of Korea and to organize AD2000 committees in each one of them. In each of these cities and towns Christian leaders from different denominations are encouraged to establish a citywide AD2000 committee to take the basic elements of the national plan and adapt it to their own city.</p>

<h3>What Is The National Korean AD2000 Plan?</h3>

<p>The national AD2000 & Beyond Movement plan in Korea emphasizes several key elements, as noted in the beautiful 27 page 8 1/2 x 11 colored brochure of the Korean Movement. First is the October 1993 "Prayer Through the 10/40 Window" ; second, the "Day to Change the World" June 25, 1994; third is GCOWE '95; fourth, the "March for Jesus;" fifth, the "1-1-1 Prayer Plan"; and the sixth key element is the social implications of the gospel transforming society.</p>

<h3>1. October "Prayer Through the Window"</h3>

<p>Each of the citywide committees will be deciding on how to implement the call to fast and pray through the 10/40 Window countries during October 1993. Several of the 53 Korean AD2000 tracks or resource networks have made additional plans for implementing this call to prayer. The youth track, for example, is encouraging 2000 college students in Seoul to engage in concerted prayer for the 10/40 Window countries between October 3-22. They will then gather on the university campuses for a closing prayer rally involving some 30,000 students in Seoul.</p>

<h3>2. "Day to Change the World" on June 25, 1994</h3>

<p>Korean Christian leaders hope that this day will be proclaimed by the National Assembly of Korea as the National Day of Prayer. June 25 happens to be the day that Korea was split in two parts, North Korea and South Korea, and thus carries special meaning. Thus, one of the prayer foc the re-unification of South and North Korea. The Korean AD2000 Executive Committee expects that two million Christians will gather for prayer on June 25, 1994 in the Olympic Stadium in Seoul. Everybody will be invited to remain there all night in prayer.</p>

<h3>3. GCOWE '95, May 17-26, 1995</h3>

<p>Apart from hosting GCOWE '95 at the beautiful Korean World Mission Center, the Korean AD2000 Committee has agreed to raise the expenses for food, housing and internal transportation within Korea for close to 3,000 delegates from the Two- Thirds World. They envision mobilize the churches of Korea by asking each of 5,000 local churches to adopt one of these delegates as a special pray focus between January 1994 and the meeting in May 1995. They will be given a brief testimony and photo of the participant they choose.</p>

<h3>4. March for Jesus on June 25, 1994</h3>

<p>Two million Koreans are expected to participate in the March for Jesus on June 25. This massive march will have several results: 1) it will give public testimony to Jesus Christ, raising interest in the minds of the general public about the person of Jesus, and 2) it will present to the public the reality of a church united, thus demonstrating the unity of the body of Christ</p>

<h3>5. "1-1-1 Prayer Plan"</h3>

<p>This prayer movement encourages all Korean Christians to pray at 1:00 p.m. every day for one minute.They will pray for 1) for the evangelization of the country and the whole world, 2) for one specific person that they want to be saved, 3) for their pastor and the revival of their church, and 4) for one of the 4,700 districts of 5,000 people each in North Korea.</p>

<h3>6. Social Transformation</h3>

<p>The special issues forum is designed to surface key social issues that the church must face and deal with. The format is a lecture by a person knowledgeable on the subject, followed by a time of questions. To date there have been three forums, beginning in December of 1992. The most recent, held June 12, attracted some 500 people.</p>

<p>One of the major projects involves challenging 100,000 students each to adopt and pray for one district of North Korea. The hope is that 10,000 of these students will decide to take one- to two-year breaks from college studies to live as Christ's personal representatives in the districts for which they have prayed. Their goal: to plant a church there and to serve the community. To date more than 35,000 students have committed themselves to this.</p>

<h3>Tracks Or Resource Networks</h3>

<p>Fifty three affinity-group tacks have been formed in the Korean AD2000 Movement. While some are still in the organizational development stage, some appear to have a full head of steam. The Singspiration Track, for example, encourages praising God through singing. Geared mainly to the young, the y plan to have united praise fests in the five largest cities of Korea. On May 5 and 19, singspirations were held in two cities. At one, more than 10,000 participated; at the other more than 20,000. At their five-day scheduled retreat, 50,000 youth are expected.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>Today 35 full-time and part time staff crowd the fifth floor of the Korean Center for World Mission to handle the multiple activities and demands of the growing AD2000 initiatives and preparation for GCOWE '95. All of this was inspired by participating with the global AD2000 & Beyond Movement. Yet the Korean AD2000 Movement initiated their activities and organization only one year ago. It is an inspiration to see the cooperation among the various segments of the Korean church as they work toward a common vision for their country and the world and we commend their generosity in hosting GCOWE '95.</p>
