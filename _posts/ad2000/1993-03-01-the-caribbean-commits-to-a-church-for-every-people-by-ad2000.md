<h1>The Caribbean Commits to “A Church for Every People by AD2000”</h1>

<p class="author">Luis Bush</p>

<p>As the last region to adopt the strategies of the AD 2000 & Beyond Movement, the Caribbean is moving rapidly to implement these strategies and to challenge Evangelical leaders to become involved in ensuring there is a church for every people and the Gospel for every person by the year 2000.</p>

<p>Key Evangelical leaders from nine Caribbean countries and territories came together in Barbados with Luis and Doris Bush, April 12-14, for extensive discussions on the AD 2000 strategies.</p>

<p>Several key problems facing the region were identified. These included:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Increasing economic problems as small island states grapple with severe economic restructuring programs which seem to be contributing to growing unemployment (as much as 70% in some instances) and the eradication of the middle class.</li>
  <li>High levels of sexual immorality with many Caribbean countries grappling with more than 60% (in some cases as high as 85%) of their children being born outside of marriage.</li>
  <li>A continuing breakdown of family units, with the divorce rate reaching one in every three marriages in some countries.</li>
  <li>Increasing incidences of drug abuse, with related increases in violent crime.</li>
  <li>Unacceptably high levels of child and spouse abuse.</li>
  <li>The increasing marginalization of men as women lead the households (46% in Barbados) and are beginning to dominate the secondary and tertiary educational institutions, increasingly coming to the forefront of management and leadership.</li>
  <li>The failure of the Caribbean as a region and a people to embrace Christ's mandate to disciple the nations.</li>
  <li>The high level of division among Evangelicals.</li>
  <li>The high instances of witchcraft--known in the region as voodoo or obeah.</li>
</ol>

<p>The leaders noted that many of these problems provided a climate highly conducive to the spread of the Gospel of Jesus Christ. Haiti now reports more than 30% of the population being born again, while Jamaica is experiencing a move of God's Spirit akin to a revival with some 17,000 decisions being recorded in a Luis Palau crusade earlier this year. Barbados also reported increasing numbers of converts to Christ, though currently at much lower levels than Haiti and Jamaica.</p>

<p>At the conclusion of the AD 2000 meeting, participants--all of whom are now confirmed as either National Coordinators or Regional Resource Network Chairmen--issued a declaration affirming their commitment to the strategies of the AD 2000 & Beyond Movement. The declaration read in part:</p>

<p>"We commit ourselves to be used by the Lord to bring about revival in our region, not as a catch-word but as a reality, in light of AD 2000 - revitalizing, re-awakening, renewing, and rekindling the Evangelical Church through: 1) Prayer, communication, and information, 2) A new appreciation of our resources, and 3) A new inner burning for the things of God."</p>

<p>"We commit ourselves to the goal of a Church for every people and the Gospel for every person by the year 2000."</p>

<p>"We commit ourselves to join the millions of Christians around the world in the 10/40 Window focus during October 1993, in order to broaden the missionary vision of our people for world evangelization."</p>

<p>"We commit ourselves to follow-up on this AD 2000 & Beyond Meeting with a view to establishing prayer committees, task forces, research teams, mobilization teams, goal setting, consultation and cooperation programs."</p>

<p>"We commit ourselves to network with other Christian leaders within the Caribbean with the same vision for world evangelization by AD 2000."</p>

<p>"We commit ourselves to participate in the activities related to the Day to Change the World, June 25, 1994 with special emphasis on being a part of the prayer with fasting for the 10/40 Window as well as the special needs of the Caribbean."</p>

<p>This is one more significant step forward to the goal of a Church for every people and the Gospel for every person by the year 2000.</p>

<h3>Caribbean Declaration</h3>

  <li>We identify ourselves as a group of Evangelical Leaders who are deeply committed to the task of the Evangelization of the Caribbean.</li>
  <li>We met to examine the political, social, economical and spiritual condition of each country within the region, in light of AD 2000 and beyond. We acknowledge that the enormous and diverse problems we face in the Caribbean region are due in part to the fact that we have not been aggressive enough in executing the mandate of the Great Commission.</li>
  <li>We acknowledge our weaknesses, especially in the area of unity among denominations and even Local Churches.</li>
  <li>We have identified the fact that we all face very serious moral decadence in each island, but we thank God for the work of the Holy Spirit in adding thousands to the Evangelical community so that there has been a remarkable growth of the church during the past two years.</li>
  <li>We consider that we are living in a very special time in the history of the Church in this region as we move toward the year 2000, and we confirm that God has given to His servants the vision of AD 2000. We affirm that we are prepared to participate with believers from other cultures in seeing a Church for every people and the Gospel for every person by the year 2000.</li>
  <li>We recognize the tremendous importance of prayer as a primary strategy for fulfilling this awesome task of reaching the unreached peoples of the world for Christ.</li>
  <li>Furthermore, we unite together for this purpose of evangelism and intercessory prayer recognizing that God is able, available, and willing to answer prayer.</li>
  <li>We commit ourselves to be used by the Lord to bring about revival in our region, not as a catch-word but as a reality, in light of AD 2000 --revitalizing, re-awakening, renewing, and rekindling the Evangelical Church through: a) Prayer, communications, and information. b) A new appreciation of our resources. d) A new inner burning for the things of God.</li>
  <li>We commit ourselves to the goal of a Church for every people and the Gospel for every person by the year 2000.</li>
  <li>We commit ourselves to join the millions of Christians around the world in the 10/40 Window focus during October, 1993 in order to broaden our vision for world evangelization.</li>
