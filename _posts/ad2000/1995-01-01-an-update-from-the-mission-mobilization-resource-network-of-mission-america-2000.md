<h1>An Update from the Mission Mobilization Resource Network of Mission America 2000</h1>

<p class="author">Mission Frontiers</p>

<p>In conjunction with the previous article, the following is a short interview with Dave Imboden, USCWM Regional Offices Coordinator and Co-coordinator for the Mission Mobilization Resource Network of Mission America 2000.</p>

<h3>MF: What role does the USCWM have in the Mission America 2000 campaign?</h3>

<p>Dave: The MA2000 campaign has five dimensions: 1) Prayer, 2) Evangelism, 3) Research, 4) Racial Reconciliation and 5) Mission Mobilization. The USCWM has already been participating in and assisting the Mission Mobilization Resource Network (MMRN) (see MF Jan/Feb '94) which was created through the impetus of Luis Bush and an AD2000 and Beyond pre-consultation for the U.S., held August, 1992. The MMRN has already begun to play a key role in the development of mission mobilization for the MA2000 campaign, having participated in a national Citywide Strategies "kick off" meeting for MA2000 in Pittsburgh, August 25-28.</p>

<h3>MF: What exactly is the MMRN planning to do through MA2000?</h3>

<p>Dave: A strategy session at the Pittsburgh meeting resulted in the following declaration: The MMRN will begin to, or in some cases, already has begun to:</p>

<ol>
  <li>connect existing mission mobilization networkers and ministries with other MA2000 networkers within cities</li>
  <li>pray for networkers to be raised up in every targeted city as well as sections of the three mega-cities, N.Y.C., L.A. and Chicago</li>
  <li>promote existing transdenominational mobilization ministries and resources from ACMC, ACMI, AIMS, Caleb Resources and the USCWM as MA2000 resources</li>
  <li>encourage area reps (from ministries mentioned in #3) to prayerfully pursue becoming networkers for their cities</li>
  <li>complete a revised mission mobilizer's handbook on key tools, ministries and networks for helping local churches and fellowships to do mission</li>
  <li>provide an annual national consultation on mission mobilization in conjunction with the national ACMC conference.</li>
</ol>

<h3>MF: What other significant developments occurred as a result of meeting in Pittsburgh?</h3>

<p>Dave: Due largely to the presence of David Ripley, SIM's National Director of Ethnic Focus Ministry, much discussion in our strategy group surrounded the need for vision and training for local churches to pursue cross-cultural outreach and church planting. The need for this kind of training is due to the multi-ethnic realities that exist throughout American cities. Because local neighborhood evangelism will be taking place throughout entire cities there will be many encounters with different cultures. Also, most Christians from any significant size city today have a good chance of working with, going to school with, or living next to someone from another culture. These are opportunities that MA2000 will certainly want to pursue via friendship evangelism and the use of tools like the Jesus video.</p>

<p>Another critical issue that surfaced during our discussion and related to the above issue is the need for demographic and ethnographic studies. SIM is an example of an agency already doing work with local churches that are serious about working with ethnic peoples in their communities. An initial step that SIM takes in beginning involvement in a city is to do ethnographic studies.</p>

<h3>MF: What contribution do you feel the U.S. Center will be able to make to the MA2000 campaign?</h3>

<p>Dave: For one, it is very obvious that a very significant network has been developing through the many Perspectives classes that have been held in dozens of cities throughout the U.S. for the past twenty years. Currently there are over 25,000 alumni, 600+ trained coordinators as well as 600+ professors. Obviously many of these folks are greatly envisioned for the frontiers and are currently serving the cause in various capacities, whether as senders, goers, welcomers or mobilizers. It could very well be that many of the city-wide networkers will emerge from the Perspectives network.</p>

<p>Another very promising prospect is the fact that the USCWM is on the brink of releasing two key mobilization tools that are designed to progressively penetrate adult fellowships and study groups with frontier vision as well as help them to daily walk out their World Christian discipleship.</p>

<h3>MF: What could MF readers expect from the MMRN and MA2000, and how could they help advance the campaign?</h3>

<p>Dave: I believe MA2000 has great promise for becoming a widely recognized movement due to the numerous other movements that are getting on board (Promise Keepers, Campus Crusade's Jesus Video project, Concerts of Prayer, Prayer Summits, etc.). Also, the fact that there will be much evangelism and prayer for the lost will very likely open the hearts of many believers to also get involved in world evangelization as opportunities and direction are provided.</p>

<p>Mission Frontiers readers can pray for their own cities to get involved as well as to pray for key mission mobilization networkers to be raised up. Without this kind of prayer there is strong likelihood that nothing significant will transpire.</p>
