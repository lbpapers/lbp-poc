		    <h1>Prayer Request for Chuck Colson</h1>
			<h2 id="article-date"><time datetime="2012-04-04">April 4, 2012</time></h2>
			<p id="first-paragraph">Thank you for taking time to open our news on the Christian Worldview Coalition USA Kickoff.</p>
			<p>We just got news from Chuck Colson's secretary and greatly appreciate your prayers on his behalf and for his wife Patty at this time. Bonnie Knapton wrote:</p>
			<p>Chuck remains in critical condition following the surgery to remove a pool of clotted blood from the surface of his brain. His attending physician has told us that Chuck suffered an intracerebral hemorrhage.</p>
			<p>As of this morning, the doctor did say that Chuck is showing some encouraging signs—for which we are very grateful. The doctor told Alan Terwilleger that "Bad things happen very fast, but good things happen very slowly." So we are prepared for good things to take some time.</p>
			<p>Patty, his wife and Emily, his daughter are with him, and they are being very strong. And, as Jim Liske told all our staff yesterday: "We believe Chuck has the best medical care in the country and are so grateful for the many doctors, nurses and other medical professionals who are treating him. We believe that we serve a higher authority—the Great Physician—and are hoping and praying for Chuck's full recovery.</p>
			<p>Thank you so much for your prayers and for your love for Chuck and Patty.</p>
			<p>Yours in Jesus,</p>
