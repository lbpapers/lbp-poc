<p>The 4/14 Window refers to the demographic group ages 4 to 14, which is the most open and receptive group to spiritual and developmental input. God is calling us to a new missional focus: the 4/14 Window, the golden age of opportunity to transform the world. God is also calling us to radically change the way we view children and to respond to their strategic importance and rightful place in His kingdom. This often-ignored and suffering people group can be transformed into a precious window of opportunity.</p>

<p>The Bible commands every Christian to “speak up for those who cannot speak for themselves, for the rights of all who are destitute” (Proverbs 31:8, niv). The Shema (Deuteronomy 6:4-7; 11:19) admonishes us to communicate God’s grace to our children. Psalm 78:4 (niv) declares, "We will tell the next generation the praiseworthy deeds of the LORD, his power, and the wonders he has done." Jesus affirms this in Luke 18:16 (niv): "Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these."</p>

<p>In God’s hands, children can become agents of transformational mission under the headship of Jesus Christ. The needs, nature and challenges of raising up a new generation out of the 4/14 Window are presented in <em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/14-Window-Raising-Generation-Transform/dp/0984116907">The 4/14 Window</a></em> by Luis Bush (Compassion: 2009).</p>

<p>Raising Up a New Generation from the 4/14 Window to Transform the World (a.k.a. 4/14 Window Global Initiative) requires a bold process of collaboration and mobilization that seeks to obey God’s call to this new missional focus.</p>
