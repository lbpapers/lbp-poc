excerpt: "I was introduced to Luis Bush several years ago by our mutual friend, Dr. Alan Johnson. Alan is a former teacher of mine at Wheaton College and has become a dear friend over the years. Alan also serves on the advisory board of ACT 3 and is a champion for me and the work that I do. Alan also has the wonderful habit of introducing his friends to other friends that he has made over the years. He is one of the most faithful retired professors I know, continuing to give himself to the kingdom actively each day."

<h1>Report of Transform World Global Interest Group Meeting</h1>
<h4>London, England 7 to 9, September 2004</h4>

<h3>I. Introductory Remarks</h3>

<p>We looked forward to considering the global transformational initiatives taking place in Africa, Asia, Latin America, Europe, North America and around the world. We came to hear from the Lord together. We linked continents around the transformation movement for a time of sharing, and seeking God for a united response of the body to the head of the Church, the Lord Jesus. We celebrated the vision and reality of the River of Life flowing from God’s throne for the healing of all nations (Rev. 22), broadening and deepening even as we go!</p>

<h3>II. What Transpired</h3>

<p>This gathering was completely an “open agenda” meeting. Beyond the dates and place set, there was no pre-set content agenda, nor were there certain predetermined outcome expectations, beyond that which came forth from the participant’s discussions through prayer and inputs/suggestions for the going-forward of this movement of the Lord that is clearly already underway.”</p>

<p>Beyond our extended times of waiting on the Lord and seasons of worship, an open time of “individual expectations” was held and articulated as shown below.</p>

<p>This was followed by an overview of what has developed thus far. Each participant provided extensive ministry reports of the history, status, struggles and blessings of the Lord into their respective lives and ministry purposes set before them. Following our “open agenda” ethos, extended times of prayer, worship and waiting on the Lord over flowed via the blessings, freedom and inspiration of the Lord in our midst!</p>

<p>Conveners for the global Transform World events beginning with Indonesian in 2005 and through 2010 presented the status of the planning for review. In the process some of the dates were readjusted. Korean leaders sent a report relating to the Korean Transform world event planned for 2007.</p>

<h3>III. What were the Outcomes</h3>
<ol type='A'>
  <li>Recognition that this movement is of the Lord. Strong affirmation that there be no global earthly structure! Persons and/or entities involved operate out of their own legal structure, as directed by their own boards, leadership and/or ministry constituency.</li>
  <li>That there is be “open participation” in the activities of this movement with each person who affirms that Jesus Christ is Lord and/or entity operating out of their own anointed/appointed “call of the Lord,” as evidenced via adherence to the Word of God.</li>
  <li>That commitment is joyfully given to “seek and observe” what God is doing, that we might join in the missio Dei, God’s mission versus, our own pre-conceived earthly definitions of our own doing.</li>
  <li>That we all be rooted in the love of God – sensing the compelling call of God to “Love our neighbor!” This ethos extends itself into the “bonding, love and respect of one another!” This fellowship is truly “THE STRUCTURE” under which we operate (vs. earthly hierarchical and/or legal structure of man’s making!)</li>
