excerpt: "Launch of Second Phase of Transform World Movement brings definition and determination to our global initiative. The is was clearly a defining moment for the church to respond. We observe that we are at a kairos moment in world history. As we gaze across the world’s horizon, there appear several issues urgently beckoning the Church to respond and engage with. Nations are in uproar, religious kingdoms are shaking, social order is declining, the poor continue to face abject poverty and injustice, marginalized – the orphans are uncared for and unloved. These are some of the many serious challenges facing the Church today and it appears as though Haggai is describing our world, where he records God is shaking anything, everywhere, and everyone (Haggai 2:6). It is therefore necessary to discern, understand and recognize, what God is doing, understanding that only what He has established will be left standing for His purpose and glory. Transform World 2012 is going to be an urgent cry and plea to the Church to consider the urgent issues of our time, which we have no choice but to respond to as the Church. Transformation is a journey that every generation must respond through faith and prayerful action. Informed cohesive prayerful action with qualified participant global representation leads to a global movement. By design, we trust that each challenge may have a godly God led response leading to a movement following Jesus, the head of the body of Christ. And we are therefore asking God to guide, and you to join us, in discovering His response to the following challenges of our day along with the next generation and  inclusion of an intentional 4/14 Window consideration as the future generation engaging with His Church in every one of the seven spheres of cultural influence."

<p>Launch of Second Phase of Transform World Movement brings definition and determination to our global initiative. This was was clearly a defining moment for the church to respond. We observe that we are at a kairos moment in world history. As we gaze across the world’s horizon, there appear several issues urgently beckoning the Church to respond and engage with. Nations are in uproar, religious kingdoms are shaking, social order is declining, the poor continue to face abject poverty and injustice, marginalized – the orphans are uncared for and unloved. These are some of the many serious challenges facing the Church today and it appears as though Haggai is describing our world, where he records God is shaking anything, everywhere, and everyone (Haggai 2:6). It is therefore necessary to discern, understand and recognize, what God is doing, understanding that only what He has established will be left standing for His purpose and glory. Transform World 2012 is going to be an urgent cry and plea to the Church to consider the urgent issues of our time, which we have no choice but to respond to as the Church. Transformation is a journey that every generation must respond through faith and prayerful action.
