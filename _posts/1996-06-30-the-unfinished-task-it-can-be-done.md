<h1>The Unfinished Task</h1>
<p>God is on the move! He is superintending the events of our time.
He is the source of the world’s growing spiritual thirst.
That means that now is the time to act!</p>

<p>It was nearly two thousand years ago that Jesus challenged His Church with the Great Commission to make disciples of all nations. Today, as we rapidly approach the 21st century, we are nearing a milestone that Christians once only dreamed of reaching. Within sight for the first time ever is a goal that for centuries has ignited the hearts of missionaries: “A church for every people and the Gospel for every person.” </p>

<p>This great “Unfinished Task” is
the motivational goal of the AD2000 &
Beyond Movement—not only that it
be done, but that it be done by the end of
the millennium—by December 31,
2000!</p>

<p>Perhaps this overwhelming goal
sounds too ambitious, too far-reaching.
But consider for a moment Coca-Cola’s well-publicized goal to place “a
Coke in the hand of every person on
earth by the year 2000.” If reaching the
entire world with a soft drink is not
too ambitious for a business corporation,
how much more should Christ’s own
Church be committed to reaching that
same world, in the same time frame,
with the saving Gospel of Jesus Christ?</p>

<p>A hundred years ago, evangelist
D. L. Moody said concerning the spread
of the Gospel to the whole world by
the end of 1900, “It can be done; it ought
to be done; it must be done.” However, five years before the end of the century, his colleague, A.T. Pierson, conceded, “We despaired of hope.”</p>

<p>Today, a few years before the
end of our century and millennium, hope
and anticipation have regained the
upper hand over despair and pessimism.
More than 4,000 Christian leaders
representing 186 countries have committed themselves in writing to the goal of a
church for every people and the Gospel for every person by the year 2000.
With that common goal in sight, they
gathered in May of 1995 for the Global
Consultation on World Evangelization (GCOWE ‘95) in Seoul, Korea,
which Ralph Winter—founder of the
U.S. Center for World Mission—said may
have been “the most strategic Christian gathering in history.”</p>

<p>It is apparent, then, that many
Christian leaders from around the world
believe “The Unfinished Task” can
indeed be finished. They have committed
themselves and their resources to the
effort, joining hands to seek completion
of the task in this century. Embracing
the conviction of D. L. Moody, they have
accepted even more strongly that, “It
can be done; it ought to be done; it must
be done.”</p>

<p>It Can Be Done!</p>

<p>The first thing we must understand about the goal of “a church for every people and the Gospel for every
person” is that the greatest portion of the
task has already been done. As Operation World author Patrick Johnstone
(Chairman of the AD2000 Unreached
Peoples Network) has observed, “There is
cause for much praise to God in the
progress over the past 200 years, and
more especially in the past 30, and
cautious hope for the initial attainment of
our goals.”</p>
