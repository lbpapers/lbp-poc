      <h1>4/14 Window Movement in China</h1>
    <h2 id="article-date"><time datetime="2011-11-16">November 16, 2011</time></h2>
    <p id="first-paragraph">The purpose of the trip to China was to encourage the raising up of a new generation from the 4/14 Window to transform China and beyond. A pastor observed that "many Chinese people's hearts are empty. In the past 30 years, the moral standard has been getting worse." The 4/14ers are desperate. A survey taken four months ago of 4500 thirteen to eighteen year olds from 12 cities indicated that 41% of those who took the survey had thought of committing suicide in the previous three months and 34% had tried to do so.</p>

The map of Beijing to which Pastor Lee and I are pointing identifies the locations of the cell groups, listing the names of group leaders and the location addresses. Now there are 60 groups, according to Pastor Lee. He teaches the leaders every Wednesday and bases the lesson on the Sunday morning sermon. The home groups meet mainly for discussion.
