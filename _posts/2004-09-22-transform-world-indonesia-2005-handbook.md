<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>Through the World Inquiry, a consultative process involving Christian leaders from around the world, two clear and consistent messages have emerged as we begin the 21st Century:</p>
<ul>
  <li>First, a renewed call for the whole Church to take the whole Gospel to the whole world.</li>
  <li>And second, a new paradigm of Mission as Transformation to describe what God is doing in our world in building His Kingdom.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the midst of a fallen, broken world needing transformation:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Individuals are being called to be conformed to the image of Christ and transformed by His indwelling Spirit.</li>
  <li>Churches are being challenged to be renewed and reformed to align with God’s greater purposes and be transformed in the process.</li>
  <li>Cities and nations are being impacted and transformed as God fulfills His purposes for the nations in our time.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Vision of “Mission as Transformation” is to see all nations redeemed, restored, and transformed, as cultures increasingly reflect the value system of the Kingdom of God — now and in the future — that the power, the presence and the peace of God be experienced by all.</p>
