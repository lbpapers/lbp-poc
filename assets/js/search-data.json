In The Yes Effect, Dr. Bush shares his own story as well as inspiring stories of individuals and organizations around the world whose acts of love and justice are bringing hope and transformation in places of misery and immobility. From the orphans weeping in Bihar, India, to garbage collectors in Cairo, Egypt—from the single mom trying to find a way to feed her family as a Syrian refugee, to the Church cowering under government control—God is at work in surprising places. And this transformation is sparked when ordinary people say yes to God, igniting an ongoing global chain reaction that sees glimpses God’s kingdom springing up all over the world. Ultimately, The Yes Effect will give you an encouraging window into worldwide efforts to spread the gospel, and it will inspire you to give God your “yes”—and like so many others before you, become part of God’s global story of transformation.

    "content": "Plan Pampano - Base para Multiplicar Discipulos y Etiopia Luis Bush Introducción: La pregunta ante nosotros es ¿cómo encender el fuego de un movimiento de discipulado para que se conviertan en agentes de misión usado por Dios en sus comunidades y nación? Descubrimos la semilla plantada que puede cambiar el mundo a través de un discípulo haciendo el movimiento en Juan 15: 5 donde Jesús dice a sus discípulos: “Yo soy la vid; vosotros los pámpanos. Si permanecéis en mí y yo en ti, que te va a dar mucho fruto. Aquellos que permanecen en la vid verdadera experimentan una profunda seguridad de una íntima relación con el Señor Jesucristo, que alimenta el corazón para llevar fruto como Sus agentes de misión. El contexto del encargo del Plan Pámpano por Jesús a sus discípulos pone de relieve la importancia de este mandato de la misión de sus seguidores. Habiendo retirado Judas el Iscariote del Apocento Alto, Jesús les dijo a sus 11 discípulos que no hablaría mucho más con ellos, porque ya venía el príncipe de este mundo...» y luego dijo Levantaos. ¡Vamos de aquí! Sucedió en el camino al Huerto de Getsemaní, donde será traicionado y arrestado Jesús y luego condenado a muerte y obligado a llevar su cruz el día siguiente alrededor de las 8 de la mañana a morir por los pecados de la humanidad en la Cruz del Calvario. En ese camino del Aposento Alto a Huerto de Getsemaní esa noche con sus once discípulos les comisiona a sus discípulos con el Plan Pámpano de Discipulado de la próxima generación de discípulos.

    "content": "Plan Pampano - Base Biblica Luis Bush Introducción: El Discipulado de Jesús, Plan Pámpano para los Discípulos, expresado en Juan 15:1-17, provee una base sólida bíblica para encender los fuegos de un movimiento de hacer discípulos alimentado a los jóvenes de la 4/14 para que ellos lleguen a ser agentes de la misión de Dios. El modelo de discipulado de Jesús ilustra una praxis cristiana compartida que resulta de la interacción con el texto bíblico a través de los lentes de una experiencia personal con una perspectiva de aplicación en la vida del discípulo. La fe es más aprendida que enseñada al escuchar y comprometerse con la Palabra en un grupo afín que provee las bases para una fe creciente para servir en los propósitos del reino de Dios como su agente de misión. Aprendemos mejor a través de relaciones. La formación espiritual que conduce a llegar a ser agentes de misión edifica la identidad cristiana, comunidad, integridad y diversidad centrada en la persona de Jesucristo. A.B. Bruce demuestra como los discípulos llegaron a ser los apóstoles de la iglesia al caminar con el maestro. Las primeras 13 sesiones en el Plan Pámpano son lecciones de la vida de Jesucristo para nuevos discípulos, tomadas del libro “La Capacitación de los Doce”, por A.B. Bruce. Aquellos que permanecen en la vid verdadera experimentan una profunda seguridad de una íntima relación con el Señor Jesucristo, que alimenta el corazón para llevar fruto como Sus agentes de misión. Las sesiones 1-13 de grupos pequeños están diseñadas para realizarlas en 3 meses, tomando una sesión por semana, preferiblemente a la misma hora, en el mismo lugar con las mismas 13 personas. Una vez completadas las 13 semanas, es tiempo para que salgas e identifiques, selecciones y reclutes 12 personas para asociarlos, animarlos y retarlos usando el mismo material.

    "content": "Jesus&#39; Discipleship Branch Plan - Practice Luis Bush Introduction: Jesus&#39; Discipleship Branch Plan for Nurturers, presented in John chapter 15:1-17, provides a sound biblical basis for lighting the fires of a disciple making movement by youth nurturing the 4/14ers so that they become God’s agents of mission. Jesus’ discipleship model illustrates shared Christian praxis which results from the interaction with the biblical text through the lens of personal experience with a view to application in the life of the disciple. Faith is more caught than taught so hearing and engaging in the Word with an affinity group provides the basis for growing faith to serve in God’s Kingdom purposes as His agent of mission. We learn best through relationships. Spiritual formation that leads to becoming agents of mission builds Christian identity, community, integrity, and diversity centered on the person of Jesus Christ. A.B. Bruce demonstrates how disciples became the apostles for the church as they walked with the Master. The first 13 sessions in this Branch Plan are all about lessons from the life of Christ for new disciples, taken from the “The Training of the Twelve,” by A.B. Bruce. Those who abide in the True Vine experience the deep settled assurance of an intimate relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ that ignites the heart to bear fruit as His agent of mission. Small group sessions 1 to 13 are designed to take three months taking one session per week, preferable at the same time and the same place with the same thirteen people. Once you have completed the thirteen weeks it’s time for you to go and identify, select and recruit 12 people to associate, mutually encourage and challenge using this same material.

    "title": "Abiding Principles - Mission as Transformation",
    "content": "Abiding Principles - Mission as Transformation March 20, 2013 An effort to define a comprehensive approach to transformation must be “rooted in the theology of the mission of the Kingdom of God and seeks to express the Lordship of Jesus over every aspect of life, economic, religious, personal, and political. It does not give priority to any area of life as an area for mission . . . but this change will be effected whenever people address issues of life directly, rooted in a gospel perspective.”1 Transformation is a concept rooted in the New Covenant (see John 4:14, Romans 12:2, 2 Corinthians 3:18, 5:17, and I John 3:9). The term itself derives from the Greek word “metamorphoo” which means to change from one degree of glory to another, with ever increasing glory. It is the spiritual equivalent of a caterpillar being metamorphosed into a butterfly. As the head of the church, Christ initiates and His body— the church responds—as one body. The basic idea behind “transformation coordination” is that, not only can we do more together than we can separately, but we move to a new ministry realm that operates on entirely new laws of input and output. Like the gushing forth of waters, the love of God through the people of God unleashes multiple mission initiatives in which divine resources are channeled through willing servants to meet human needs to the glory of God. A transformed world is a place where the power, the presence, and the peace of God are experienced by all. The power of God is unleashed. The peace of God rules. Shalom-Salaam embrace. The presence of God fills the earth. Transformation is the progressive and ongoing measurable supernatural impact of the presence and power of God working in, through and apart from the Church on human society and structures. In the church, this is characterized by increased holiness of life, reconciliation in relationships, and appetite for prayer and worship. In the culture, this may be characterized by pervasive awareness of the reality of God, a radical correction of social ills, a commensurate decrease in crime rates, supernatural blessing on local commerce, healing of the brokenhearted (the alienated and disenfranchised), and regenerative acts of restoring the productivity of the land. To this end, a catalytic core of saints typically embrace a lifestyle of persistent repentance, humility, and sacrificial servant hood that attracts the favor and presence of God, and breaks the predominating influences of the ruling power structures of human flesh and negative spiritual forces. Transformation involves seeking positive change in the whole of human life materially, socially and spiritually, by recovering our true identity as human beings created in the image of God and discovering our true vocation as productive stewards, faithfully caring for our world and people.2 Transformation is the change from a condition of human existence contrary to God’s purposes to one in which people are able to enjoy fullness of life in harmony with God. According to the biblical view of human life, then, transformation is the change from a condition of human existence contrary to God’s purposes to one in which people are able to enjoy fullness of life in harmony with God (John 10:10, Col. 3:8-15, Eph. 4:13). As Duane Litfin has observed, Christ’s church has often found it difficult to find and maintain a proper biblical balance between word and deed.5 At times the pendulum has swung toward words at the expense of deeds as the church has lost touch with its social conscience. At other times our concern for justice and mercy has led to a benign neglect of our verbal witness. But both of these extremes must be avoided. According to the Bible, the proclaimed Gospel is “the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes” (Rom. 1:16). This verbal witness is indispensable and nothing can replace it. On the other hand, our deeds constitute the crucial framework within which that verbal witness is heard. Our deeds have the power to “adorn” (Titus 2:10) that Gospel or bring it into disrepute. As the Apostle John put it, “let us not love merely in word or talk but in deed and in truth” (1 John 3:18). In Transform World 2020 we are committed to a biblically-based mission of transformation the Jesus Way, by word and deed. Transformation is a reference to two points of time in a city’s history: where the city is now and where it once was. For a growing number of cities, the language that best describes the degree of societal change occurring between those two historic points is transformation. Deep and profound change is possible in human beings and is equally possible for the social organisms that we call cities and communities.3 An effort to define a comprehensive approach to transformation must be “rooted in the theology of the mission of the Kingdom of God and seeks to express the Lordship of Jesus over every aspect of life, economic, religious, personal, and political. It does not give priority to any area of life as an area for mission . . . but this change will be effected whenever people address issues of life directly, rooted in a gospel perspective.”4 A comprehensive movement to bless the nations includes many emphases. Transformational leadership engages a new generation in participatory leadership with current leadership. A transformed world is a place where the power, the presence, and the peace of God are experienced by all. The power of God is unleashed. The peace of God rules. Shalom-Salaam embrace. The presence of God fills the earth.

    "title": "A Starfish Structure",
    "content": "A Starfish Structure March 20, 2013 Global Context regarding Structures of Mission and TWC Movements are going to rise and fall with increased rapidity in the world in which we live. That is because the context around us is changing so rapidly. Organizational structures can’t hope to keep up with these rapid changes. As a documentation of past effectiveness, most organizational structure looks back, not forward. Structures are usually built to protect a “brand,” exercise quality control, enhance communication, secure property, or perpetuate and replicate processes. One needs a “brand” if the organization is raising capital from a broader public. Our natural default position when something good happens is “programme or package it” so that it can be scaled up. Structure and leadership consume a greater amount of resources. Tim Keller has said: “An organization is more top-down, structured and controlling. Movements are more grass roots, dynamic and collaborative. Movements are dynamic, self-propagating, and encouraging to others to start similar efforts, without owning them.” We have decided that we are not going to try to protect our “brand” of transformation. TWC does not seem to have any of those functional needs except to possibly enhance communication. Committed Core The base of a movement in today’s world is a committed core of people, who trust and respect one another and apply their gifts and creativity to God’s common existential calling on their lives. There will always be movement of people into and out of the motivational and empowering circle because of very permeable, shifting, and porous boundaries. Diversity of gifts, experience, and background within the core provide a necessary flexibility to keep renewal going. This diversity must be protected and nurtured as the natural tendency of the core is to homogenize. Download PDF: A-Startfish-Structure.pdf",

    "title": "Report of the First Leadership Encounter of \"Dignidad América 2020\"",
    "content": "Serving | Catalyzing | Facilitating Report of the First Leadership Encounter of &quot;Dignidad América 2020&quot; February 13, 2013 First Leadership Encounter of “Dignidad América 2020” Bogotá, Colombia, Febrero 4 and 5, 2013 This meeting was aptly named the “first Latin American (Christian) leadership encounter” of the present century. Two hundred and thirty top Christian leaders of practically every nation and of 30 Colombian cities gathered in Bogota to face together the task of transforming their nations. The meeting was convened by two continental leaders: the preeminent Latin American evangelist Alberto Mottesi and Luis Bush, author of several international transformation initiatives. They were joined by the Colombian founders of “Proyecto Dignidad,” Ricardo Arias, a Christian statesman who directs the National Savings Fund and Pastor Eduardo Gómez, head of Latinoamérica Nueva. Several Colombian government officials delivered messages, led by the President, Juan Manuel Santos and the Attorney General, Dr. Alejandro Ordoñez. Other foreign dignitaries also delivered messages, including the Minister of Interior of Honduras, Dr. Africo Madrid, the former presidential advisor of Paraguay, Dr. Carlos Walde, the prominent prayer leader Cindy Jacobs, the leader of urban church coalitions of New York , Pastor Joseph Mattera and the venerable Dr. Kim Bumil, presidential counselor and head of the Canaan Farmers School of South Korea. Also present were leaders of several continental Christian leadership networks, among them Arnold Enns of COICOM, Hector Pardo of “Call-to-All,” Ricardo Luna, President of CONELA (who participated digitally), Rolando Justiniano of City Transformation, Braulio Portes of the Christianization Movements, Yarley Niño of the 4-14 Window, leaders of Transforma Latinoamérica and of la Red Christian Businessmen Network. In the words of Alberto Mottesi, “the Lord gathered us here to begin a new day.” Veteran observers of evangelical growth in Latin America confirm that a new day is really dawning for the region. In a way, this meeting represents the fruit of seeds planted for many years among the Christian leaders by the regional conveners and others who have been gathering the continent´s leadership to prepare the way for transformation. Alberto Mottesi has preached before 20 million people in more than 50 cities of Latin America, and since 1992 has been gathering also high level civic leaders in them. Luis Bush, on the other hand, has facilitated the creation of international Christian leadership networks such as COMIBAM in 1985, AD 2000 in 1990, Transform World in 2003, and the 4-14 Window in 2008. Latin America´s Christian leaders have been gathering internationally with some frequency for over two decades. COICOM, the international fraternity of Christian communicators has gathered thousands annually since 1992. Campus Crusade for Christ organized several leadership summits, and Semilla convened Christians in politics ten times during the nineties. However, several elements distinguished this meeting from others: the caliber of leaders participating, a good percentage of whom have leadership at the highest regional and national level. the diversity of substantial leaders, from political, civic and business, not just ecclesial and ministerial fields. the intense and deep worship, and the frequent prayer that returned the participants once and again to the presence of God. the presentation of concrete principles, plans and models of transformation. One plan in particular is worth highlighting, which is about to be implemented in Colombia. It aims at turning a million low-income tenants into homeowners, cultivating a culture of savings rather than borrowing while establishing healthy social rules in their new urbanizations. A model worthy of emulation is the Character Foundation of Paraguay, which is financed with the double-tithes of several Christian entrepreneurs and is investing in fortifying the church, the pastors and reaching to the poor though dozens of social projects, such as 150 soup kitchens in Asunción. The tone and the content of the presentations and of the informal dialogue among the participants show that the evangelical people of Latin America are maturing. Their leaders are ready to outline a clear agenda of work: To seek justice, foundation of peace, and to promote the prosperity of nations To work for the elimination of extreme poverty, corruption and violence. To protect life, strengthen the family, and to favor children and youth. This agenda is much more concrete and ambitious than any declared until now in meetings such as this. More important, they committed to do it as part of their obedience to the divine mandate: “Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.” “Dignidad Colombia 2020” the project advanced by the hosts was presented as an inspiration for all to declare principles, make plans and create models under the rubric of “Dignidad América 2020.” The Colombians declared “The Colombia we dream” to be a “just, tolerant, egalitarian and peaceful” society, where “the care of human needs is primary”, whose public servants fear God and put first the common good, where truth prevails in private and public actions. They outlined their plans with proposals for a Colombian they described as “educational, agrarian, social, family-centered and under God.” There were some deficiencies in the program, intended for 120 but attended by 230. There lacked sufficient space for the participation and dialogue among the attendees. Some protested the exaggerated tribute paid to the Colombian authorities, which at times seemed to promise the political support of the evangelical people. And there were relatively few young leaders, no doubt due to the high level of leadership invited and the fact that they came at their own expense. That absence was compensated by a symbolic expression of repentance carried out before three young leaders, who were commissioned to carry forward the “torch of Transformation.” Prepared by José L.

La reunión fue convocada por dos líderes continentales: el preeminente evangelista latinoamericano Alberto Mottesi y Luis Bush, gestor internacional de iniciativas transformadoras, junto con los fundadores del movimiento “Dignidad” de Colombia, el estadista Ricardo Arias, Director del Fondo de Ahorro Nacional y el pastor Eduardo Gómez, Director de Latinoamérica Nueva. Además de los convocadores, trajeron ponencias otras autoridades del gobierno colombiano, encabezadas por el Presidente de la República, Juan Manuel Santos y el Procurador General de la Nación, Dr. Alejandro Ordoñez. Asimismo trajeron mensajes dignatarios extranjeros, entre ellos el Ministro del Interior de Honduras, Dr. Áfrico Madrid, el ex - ministro consejero de la Presidencia de Paraguay, Dr. Carlos Walde, la reconocida líder de oración Cindy Jacobs, el autor y líder de coaliciones eclesiásticas urbanas de Nueva York, el Pastor Joseph Mattera y el venerable Kim Bumil, consejero presidencial y líder de la Escuela de Agricultores “Canaán” de Corea del Sur. Estuvieron presentes también líderes de varias redes continentales de liderazgo cristiano, entre ellos Arnold Enns de COICOM, Hector Pardo de “Call-to-All”, Ricardo Luna, Presidente de CONELA (participó digitalmente), Rolando Justiniano de Transformación de Ciudades, Braulio Portes del Movimiento de Cristianización, Yarley Niño de la Ventana 4-14, líderes de Transforma Latinoamérica y de la Red de Hombres de Negocios Cristianos. En las palabras de Alberto Mottesi, “El Señor nos reunió aquí para comenzar un nuevo día.” Veteranos observadores del crecimiento evangélico en América Latina corroboran que realmente amanece un nuevo día en la región. En cierto modo, este encuentro representa la cosecha sembrada por muchos años por los convocadores continentales y por otros que por décadas han reunido al liderazgo continental preparando el camino para la transformación. Alberto Mottesi , quien ha predicado ante 20 millones de personas en más de 50 ciudades de Latinoamérica, desde 1992 viene reuniendo también a líderes cívicos de alto nivel en todas ellas. Por su parte Luis Bush ha facilitado la formación de redes internacionales de líderes cristianos, como COMIBAM en 1985, AD 2000 en 1990, Transform World en 2003, y la Ventana 4-14 en 2008. Los líderes cristianos de Latinoamérica se vienen reuniendo internacionalmente con frecuencia desde hace más de dos décadas. COICOM, la confraternidad internacional de comunicadores cristianos ha reunido a miles de líderes anualmente desde 1992. La Cruzada Estudiantil y Profesional para Cristo organizó varias cumbres continentales de liderazgo y Semilla convocó a cristianos en política diez veces en la década de los ´90. Sin embargo, varios elementos distinguen esta reunión de otras 80: El calibre de los líderes reunidos, un buen porcentaje de los cuales ejercen al más alto nivel de liderazgo, continental y nacional. La presencia substancial de una diversidad de líderes, incluyendo políticos, cívicos y empresariales, no sólo los eclesiales y ministeriales. La intensa y profunda adoración, y la frecuente oración que retornó una y otra vez a los participantes a la presencia del Señor. La presentación de planes, principios y modelos concretos de transformación. Cabe destacar un plan, a punto de ser implementado en Colombia, que intenta transformar a un millón de inquilinos de escasos ingresos en propietarios, fomentando una cultura de ahorro en lugar de endeudamiento y estableciendo parámetros sociales saludables en sus nuevas urbanizaciones. Un modelo digno de emulación es el de la Fundación Carácter de Paraguay, que financiada con el doble diezmo de varios empresarios cristianos está invirtiendo en docenas de proyectos de asistencia social, incluyendo 150 comedores populares en Asunción. El tono y el contenido de las presentaciones y del diálogo informal entre los participantes indican que el pueblo evangélico latinoamericano ha madurado. Sus líderes están prontos a delinear una clara agenda de trabajo, mucho más ambiciosa y concreta que ninguna antes declarada en reuniones como esta: Eliminar la pobreza extrema, la corrupción y la violencia. Proteger la vida, fortalecer la familia y favorecer la niñez y la juventud Y lo importante es que se comprometieron a hacerlo como parte de su obediencia al mandato divino “Venga tu Reino, hágase tu voluntad así en la tierra como en el cielo.” “Dignidad Colombia 2020” fue el nombre que dieron los anfitriones a su proyecto, como inspiración para que todos los cristianos de América declaren principios, hagan planes y creen modelos bajo el lema de “Dignidad América 2020.” Los colombianos declararon “la Colombia que soñamos” una sociedad justa, tolerante, igualitaria, con evidencia de paz en la que prime la atención de las necesidades del ser humano, cuyos servidores públicos teman a Dios y cuiden del bien común, donde prevalezca la verdad en las acciones públicas y privadas. Ellos organizaron sus propuestas bajo las rúbricas de una Colombia educadora, agraria, social, basada en la familia y llena de Dios. Hubo deficiencias en el programa, diseñado para 120 participantes pero que tuvo que acomodar 230. No hubo suficiente espacio de participación y diálogo entre los concurrentes. Algunos protestaron la pleitesía rendida a las autoridades políticas colombianas, a quienes se les sugirió prácticamente que contarán con el apoyo político del pueblo evangélico. Y hubo relativamente pocos líderes jóvenes, debido tal vez al alto calibre de líderes que participaron a costo propio. Esa ausencia fue compensada por una expresión simbólica de desagravio a tres jóvenes líderes presentes que fueron comisionados a llevar adelante la antorcha de la Transformación. Informe de José L.

    "content": "Transform World Vision 2020 overview November 6, 2012 Launch of Second Phase of Transform World Movement brings definition and determination to our global initiative. This was was clearly a defining moment for the church to respond. We observe that we are at a kairos moment in world history. As we gaze across the world’s horizon, there appear several issues urgently beckoning the Church to respond and engage with. Nations are in uproar, religious kingdoms are shaking, social order is declining, the poor continue to face abject poverty and injustice, marginalized – the orphans are uncared for and unloved. These are some of the many serious challenges facing the Church today and it appears as though Haggai is describing our world, where he records God is shaking anything, everywhere, and everyone (Haggai 2:6). It is therefore necessary to discern, understand and recognize, what God is doing, understanding that only what He has established will be left standing for His purpose and glory. Transform World 2012 is going to be an urgent cry and plea to the Church to consider the urgent issues of our time, which we have no choice but to respond to as the Church. Transformation is a journey that every generation must respond through faith and prayerful action. Informed cohesive prayerful action with qualified participant global representation leads to a global movement. By design, we trust that each challenge may have a godly God led response leading to a movement following Jesus, the head of the body of Christ. And we are therefore asking God to guide, and you to join us, in discovering His response to the following challenges of our day along with the next generation and inclusion of an intentional 4/14 Window consideration as the future generation engaging with His Church in every one of the seven spheres of cultural influence. Ideological Challenge: Issues surrounding Islamic fundamentalism, the turnaround within the Middle-East along with other global issues. Family Challenge: An intentional focus on Christian Marriage and the Family with a call to integrity, purity and witness. Orphan Challenge: A focus on the care for the orphans with a view to a world without orphans (WWO) Poverty Challenge: Reviewing poverty lines globally with a focus on availability of basic needs among the poorest communities in the world. Human Rights Challenge: Toward a civil society including casteism and the North Korea Issue. Christ’s Missional Challenge: Reaching the Last and the Least. Celebration Challenge: Identifying, connecting, and encouraging 24/7 Houses of Prayer and Praise to God in every nation. &quot;Civilizations develop and flourish in response to the challenges they face with creative new ideas. When they are rigid, failing to respond to challenges, they decline.&quot; (A.

    "title": "50 Largest Unreached Peoples",
    "content": "50 Largest Unreached Peoples October 26, 2012 Christ’s concern is to reach the last and the least. Each of the seven Transform World Challenges is called to have a special focus on these people groups and participate toward the expected outcomes. The Challenges are: Ideological Challenge of Islam; Family Challenge; Orphan Challenge; Poverty Challenge; Human Rights Challenge; Christ’s Missional Challenge; and the Celebration Challenge. For example, two of the expected outcomes of Christ’s Missional Challenge are to reach the 50 largest unreached people groups by 2020 and to engage the 50 largest unengaged people groups by 2020. An expected outcome of the Ideological Challenge is also to reach the 50 largest unreached people groups and engage the 50 largest unengaged people groups which are Islamic, in collaboration with Transform World 2020 Christ’s Missional Challenge and the Poverty Challenge. An expected outcome of the Poverty Challenge is to build transformational, self ‐ sustainable model communities among the fifty largest unreached people groups and the fifty largest unengaged people groups. This booklet can serve as a roadmap for accomplishing these outcomes. The following pages provide listings and profiles for both the 50 largest unreached people groups (UPGs) and the 50 largest unengaged unreached people groups (UUPGs). An unreached people is a people group among which there is no indigenous community of believing Christians with adequate numbers and resources to evangelize this people group. An unengaged people is an unreached people group in which no known active onsite church planting is occurring. The relationship between these two lists is shown graphically on page 2. The profiles presented here have similar format, however, these two lists have different sources, methodology and criteria. Joshua Project provides the list of 50 largest UPGs and Finishing the Task provides the list of 50 largest UUPGs. Please see the introduction to each list (pg. 3 and 55) for more details.

Read North American Response to Challenges -- page 69 to 72 in preparation of the call1 Dear North American Delegates, It is with great joy and enthusiasm that I welcome you as members of the Transform World Summit North American delegation. Thank you for prayerful consideration over these past months as we have worked diligently with discernment to hear the heart of our Father instructing us in the way we should go. I would like to take this opportunity to invite you to join me on Thursday, September 27, 2012 from 8:00 to 9:00am (Pacific Standard Time) to review some important details leading up the conference. I would also like to briefly introduce Christopher Lucey (christopher.lucey@uscwm.org) who will be serving as your facilitator for the Global Challenges Summit in Bali. He was introduced to me through Willy Tjen and Kathy Narramore leaders of Transform Los Angeles. Christopher has a unique background having led entrepreneurial start-ups to serving as an adjunct professor designing MBA courses in Global Leadership, Management, Environmental Economics, International Development, Innovation and Entrepreneurship for the past 6 years. Currently he serves as the Managing Director of the Frontier Mission Fellowship and the Executive Director of the US Center for World Mission. Christopher is also the Co-author of the book “Pauline Pattern of Servant Leadership” with Dr. Frank Eiklor of Shalom International Outreach. As you may be aware each facilitator was asked to provide a plan for how they would serve the catalytic leaders in their region. The concept that has been submitted by Christopher is designed to address the area of greatest need during the next seven years and beyond – leadership capital (building capacity for the movement by taking the long-view). The Global Leadership Fellows Program has a comprehensive and holistic approach toward the formation of servant-leaders. The strategic purpose of this program is to increase the numbers and capacity of catalytic leaders leading up to 2020. We see the next seven years as a time to “rise and build” – this is the theme of the program. The innovative design of the program will support the formation of emerging leaders in each of the seven spheres and address the seven challenges in the process. The hope is that by 2020 a national network of highly skilled and well trained global innovative leaders will be ready to emerge having established their plans, strategies, and resourced their teams to transformation our nation, our culture and the world. The program will emphasize three key areas 1) Discipleship, 2) Stewardship and 3) Statesmanship over the next seven years leading up to 2020. The objective is to empower emerging leaders to learn how to fully align their hearts with God’s Word, learn to gain agreement with His will (and each other), so that they may commit to doing the work that God has prepared for them in advance (Jn 4:34 &amp; Eph 2:10). In so doing, we will see the acceleration of breakthroughs and the advancement of the Kingdom in all seven spheres. What makes this sustainable? The fact the our Father has made the way. And He desires to see the multiplication and development of His sons and daughters become true servants who have been trained for such a time as this. Our greatest strategy is to strengthen the bench and broaden our reach. The critical issue this initiative addresses is the tremendous need of well-trained leaders who have a clear identity rooted in Christ who will be able to stand firm and remain faithful. We know that deep personal transformation must happen first before anyone can lead significant cultural transformation in any generation. This is our privilege and our time to come along side this generation to invest in them and the future of our nation join me as we “Rise &amp; Build” together! The Transform World Global Summit 2012 (TW GS 2012) Prospectus draft (link to download) will remain a draft until review and final agreement is made by the communities committed to advocate on behalf of, engage in and collaborate in implementing the agreed upon plans by challenge, sphere of cultural influence and region in the succeeding seven years to 2020. Following TW GS 2012 the Prospectus will become the Transform World 2020 Handbook.

    "title": "2012 Fiji Prayer Convention Report",
    "content": "2012 Fiji Prayer Convention Report July 30, 2012 Acknowledgements This final report on the 2012 Fiji Prayer Convention has been prepared by Lilian Schmid, it draws on a number of resources, past and current, including Dr Geoff Waugh&#39;s book South Pacific Revivals, Community and Ecological Transformation and notes from Ps. Inosi Vono. Rev. Geoff Armitage also contributed a comprehensive chronology of the events during the Convention and this has been merged into the main body of the report. Background and History Revival on the Fiji Islands (The report below is reproduced from the website of Fusion Ministries Inc. &copy; 2007-2010 http://www.fusionministry.com/fijivideo.php?page=1) The events of the past few years on the Fiji Islands can truly be called revival. Ratu Epeli Kanaimawi, a pastor on the islands and Vice President of the ACCF (Association of Christian Churches in Fiji), was invited to the Transform World conference in Jakarta, Indonesia in May 2005, along with over 1,000 Christian leaders from around the globe. The following in an excerpt from his report...1 Community and Ecological Transformation (The following is an extract from Dr. Geoff Waugh, Journal in Fiji 2003, South Pacific Revivals, Community and Ecological Transformation.) Vuniani had visited Argentina and seen the beneficial results of reconciliation with the British over the Faulklands war, he also visited Guatemala to see the Almolonga transformation. This was a singularly dramatic community change. Jails and public bars closed, land fertility increased and crop production levels had to be seen to be believed. What he saw brought a deeper desire in his heart to see this happen to Fiji, to give room for God to bring about community and national transformation in similar ways to what he had seen overseas, he saw the need to appropriately respond to the circumstances and use the spiritual tools available to see the nation transformed. After returning to Fiji, he called some people together to seek God for solutions. They felt they should begin at Nuku, and this took place on April 1-10 2003. Nuku is about 65 Kilometres North of Suva, on the main island of Viti Levu. Continues here...2 New Wave and New Generation The 2012 Fiji Prayer Convention was held from the 2nd to the 6th July 2012 at Sigatoka Fiji. The theme was &quot;Preparing the way for New Generation.&quot; This gathering also launched Transform Fiji which is a seven year initiative to see the nation transformed with every last village in Fiji experiencing transformation by 2020. Pastor Inosi Vono, the Convener of the Convention invited Luis Bush, the International Facilitator of Transform World, Lilian Schmid, the Convener of Transforming Sydney, Michael Maeliau from the Solomon Islands, and Mr. Henrick Minder from Switzerland as guest speakers. What was the purpose of this Convention? RESTORATION Due to the different views and perspectives of different religions present within Fiji, there needs to be restoration of the original stand of why CHRISTIANITY was introduced to Fiji, and that is to bring unity and better relationships especially within the different denominations. The presence of different views within the denominations has also brought different spirit which needs to be eradicated and restored with a new and united Christ-like spirit throughout the different denominations, ethnic groups and cultural institutions and especially day to day interactions. The end result of this restoration process will be the improvement the different aspects of society be it economical, social and cultural institutions. RECONCILIATION Ongoing from the above topic after the process of restoring the much needed unified spirit their needs to be reconciliation within the different denominations to bring about unity and a new perspective for the future of Fiji. Restoration needs to be carried out between Churches to churches Church to indigenous Fijians Church to chiefs Chiefs to chiefs There is a great need for reconciliation as people in Fiji fail to recognize that the process of reconciliation is a powerful process which is being neglected at most times. REBUILDING OF THE TEMPLE OF THE LORD Once the two topics above are addressed then it could assist the process of rebuilding the temple of the Lord which is the spirit and souls of those who have been hurt. TRANSFORMATION This will follow after the three processes above have taken place, which will transform people and their souls within the community to unite and bring about change for a brighter Fiji. This will be generally the end result of the processes mentioned above. GENERATION The transformation will bring about change not only for the present generation but for the future of Fiji&#39;s children. It will also instill a new perspective for a new unified Fiji. Continues here...3 Monday 2nd July Monday afternoon at the Stadium, the opening of the Prayer gathering was a formal occasion where the chief of the province, Ratu Sakusa Makuta, officially welcomed the delegates to the land of Fiji. In a traditional ceremony the Chief was honored with the gift of a whale tooth. Michael Maeliau from the Solomon Islands brought a Shophar which was blown 4 times before presented to the chief as a gift. This official welcome from the indigenous owner of the land releases spiritual authority to the prayer gathering to pray for the land of Fiji and its people. Continues here...4 Tuesday 3rd July The second morning on Tuesday, we all came together and they invited Luis Bush to open with a prayer, they invited the whole village of Lawai to come including the children, the theme was About &#39;A New Wave for the New Generation&#39;, and the whole team came to bless the new generation. Continues here...5 Wednesday 4th July On Wednesday three significant events took place. The first was the consecration of a prayer house which was set aside as a place of prayer similar to Moses&#39; tabernacle where the Glory of the Lord would settle whenever Moses went to prayer. The second was a hilltop where the chiefs of the province were anointed. Specific prayer for the cleansing of all occult practices on the hilltops was offered from ancient days up to the present including Masonic rituals and curses. A prayer for restoration in the land was offered by Luis Bush and Ps. Inosi Vono. This prayer for Restoration officially launched Transformation Fiji which is the 7 year vision to see every village in Fiji experience Transformation by 4th July 2017. One intercessor saw the cloud of Glory descend on the mountaintop just as it did on the Mount of Transfiguration. Continues here...6 Thursday 5th July On the 5th of July Luis Bush at the meeting with Pastor Inosi and his team recommended to invite Michael Maeliau, Henrick Minder and Lilian Schmid back to Fiji and as well as Pastor Djohan Handoyo, the Chairman of Transform World Connections from Bethel Church Singapore to be the speaker at the stadium in 2013 Transform Fiji Conference. Pastor Djohan Handoyo has confirmed that he has received the invitation for next year&#39;s event. Transform Fiji result in God&#39;s blessing on Fiji to the very last village as you envisioned by the end of seven years. Continues here...7 Friday 6th July On the final evening Friday night the 6th of July 2012 Henrick Minder brought a challenge for the Christians to stand up and change their nation as mentioned in 2 Chron. 7:14. Henrick also quoted from 1 Tim 2:1 which says that praying for &quot;kings and all those in authority&quot; is of first importance and not where we usually put it, i.e. last. Rev. Geoff Armitage brought a message from Naaman (2 Kings 5) being healed of leprosy without, and the pride of his heart within. Everyone responded by dipping themselves seven times, in the river of God, as a prayer that the LORD would cleanse our hearts from the sin of pride. Lilian Schmid finished with a closing prayer: the Lord&#39;s Prayer in both the Fijian language and the English language and thanked everyone in Fiji for their generosity and their heart to transform their nation. The final message came from Inosi Vono who called for the grace of forgiveness to be exercised by all present towards anyone who had caused them offense. In conclusion he asked all the Pastors present to come on to the stage and kneel and repent of denominationalism and pride that had been separating God&#39;s family. This was a blessed place to bring the Fiji International Prayer Convention to a conclusion. Let me conclude this report with the words of Psalm 107:15: Let them give thanks to the LORD for his unfailing love and his wondrous deeds for men, for he breaks down gates of bronze and cuts through bars of iron.

    "content": "Sirviendo | Catalizando | Facilitando Una nueva temporada de cooperación a nivel regional de América Latina inicia en la Conferencia ventana 4/14 21 de Abril de 2012 &quot;Este es un momento histórico. Estamos experimentando un nuevo nivel de energía en la Iniciativa de 4/14 como resultado de la sinergia de los latinoamericanos y los coreanos que resulta de una alianza de Corea del 4/14 Ventana,&quot; dijo el pastor de Kim Nam Soo, el anfitrión de las dos primeras Cumbres mundiales 4.14 Ventana. La Alianza Coreana 4/14 se formó espontáneamente por pastor In Soo Jung (James Jung), quien recibió a más de 400 participantes de 24 países en la Conferencia Regional de América Latina de la Ventana 4/14 del 10 al 13 de abril, celebrada en su iglesia en Atlanta en asociación con otras dos iglesias coreanas. El propósito de la alianza es conectar con los latinoamericanos en sus esfuerzos para levantar una nueva generación de la ventana 4/14 para transformar el mundo. El facilitador regional de la Iniciativa 4/14 en América Latina Ricardo Luna informó que en América Latina, mas de 50,400 líderes han firmado 45,300 pactos con la ventana 4/14 con varios reconocimientos. Reconocemos la eclesiología de transformación a través del liderazgo eclesial nacional, y a la iglesia local como lo base de transformación. Son los pies de transformación en cada rincón geográfico del continente. El movimiento 4/14 anima al liderazgo que esté A FAVOR de los niños. Esto significa abrir espacios de impacto en responsabilidad, autoridad y presupuesto a favor de las generaciones. El movimiento 4/14 anima a la iglesia a que ministre CON los niños. Esto significa reconocer que ellos son agentes de transformación. El movimiento 4/14 reconoce que hay que ser COMO un niño. Esto significa reconocer que el mayor valor de un niño es ser un niño, y que necesitamos ese testimonio en nuestra vida de adultos.

El tema de la conferencia Conexión de Nueva Generación se centró en el cómo a través de los modelos emergentes de América Latina. Se exploró la forma de: (1) responder al reto de la violencia en América Latina, (2) desarrollar un plan estratégico Ventana 4/14 en un país, (3) participar de las esferas, en especial los medios de comunicación, la educación, la iglesia y la familia, (4) llevar a cabo una semana de largas sesiones de entrenamiento intensivas con niños y jóvenes de la Ventana 4/14 a fin de prepararlos para cambiar la cultura de sus naciones, (5) compañerismo en el servicio de Corea y América Latina de Dios en la respuesta al desafío de la Ventana 4/14 en América Latina (6) desatando las ataduras, (7) ¿Cómo integrar herramientas para la transformación?

En el la esfera de gobierno con la autorización oficial del Ministro de Religión que presentó un modelo de compartir material de principios y valores en respuesta a unas encuestas elaboradas sobre creencias y los comportamientos. Wehrli además es pastor Luterano, teólogo e historiador. El enriquece el trabajo del rol de educación en transformación desde Jesús hasta la reforma, y desde la reforma hasta nuestros días. La esfera de cultura existe el potencial de llegar a 760 centros culturales en Chile creando un espacio en que el Espíritu Santo puede mover. En el la esfera de educación en Chile hay una oportunidad de presentar clases desde la cosmovisión bíblica en las 900 escuelas públicas por dos horas a la semana. Iván Ruz y Larry Fredes coordinan el trabajo de 1,000 educadores evangélicos en las clases de religión requeridas por ley en las escuelas de Chile. El potencial es de llegar a 7,000 escuelas con las clases de religión requeridas en cada clase.

Modelos fueron compartieron de como llevar a cabo en trabajo educativo de valores para hacer la diferencia en la comunidad. En el la esfera de medios Gaston Bruno insiste que tenemos que conquistar la pantalla. Tomamos en cuenta el caso en Bogotá, Colombia que representa el medio estratégico para respaldar la manera continua y efectiva a modelos de transformación como la Ventana 4/14. La plataforma que se tiene cuenta con tres grandes componentes; el primero son las antenas que permiten identificar lo que mas se habla en redes sociales, segundo un equipo interdisciplinario especializado en social media, tercero una infraestructura moderna para difundir millones de mensajes. Esto nos convierte en una respuesta de transformación a millones personas que han hecho y harán del internet parte de su vida. Entre ellos 800 millones son de 4/14 anos que representa mas del 60% de esta edad escolar en todo el mundo. Reconocimos que tenemos que establecer los protocolos de como ofrecer estos recursos al mundo. Valores de Los Medios. Niños y jóvenes en América Latina pasan 26 horas a la semana escuchando música.

Mirando a los ojos, observando la atención, escuchándoles leer la Palabra de Dios, dar su testimonio, enseñar un versículo, orar por la ofrenda. Hoy día hay 53 que están siendo preparando y ya atendiendo a los otros niños. En la iglesia de tres mil miembros hoy día son 700 niños en el ministerio infantil. Caravanas y deporte activan los niños en la ciudad de Yopal cambiando la cultura.

(4)¿Cómoconducir campamentos y cursos intensivos? &quot;Transformando Naciones - Discipulando a la Generación 4/14&quot; Al entender la capacidad espiritual de los niños, nuestro ministerio cambió totalmente su enfoque, dando prioridad al discipulado de los niños, adolescentes y jóvenes. Sembrando en sus corazones y mentes los principios del Reino de Dios, que transforma todo lo que toca. Uno de los instrumentos más valiosos para alcanzarlos, es a través de Campamentos residenciales de siete días con un Currículo que integra los fundamentos de la fe cristiana, con la cosmovisión bíblica y el mandato cultural de ir a servir y llevar transformación a las ocho esferas que moldean una sociedad: familia, iglesia, gobierno, medios de comunicación, educación, economía, salud y ciencia. Ya hemos implementado este currículo en Campamentos en Hong Kong, Colombia, Panamá, Nicaragua y Puerto Rico. Y esperamos continuar multiplicándolo en los diferentes países del mundo.

Pidiendo la bendición de Dios sobre sus vidas, ministerio y la misión compartida de alcanzar la nueva generación. Eliodoro Mora, Superintendente de las Asambleas de Dios en Venezuela bendice la concurrencia coreana e hispana. Ben Hur pastor de la Promise Church en Atlanta y coauspiciador del evento recibe la bendición. b. Adorando a Dios juntos se expresa la unidad en espíritu. c. Celebrando juntos la nueva generación de la ventana 4/14 d. Sirviendo unos a otros como lo hizo Dr. Eun Moo Lee, el facilitador del evento por muchos meses y muchas horas de trabajo para preparar todo. Eun Moo Lee Pastor Nam Soo Kim ha viajado muchas veces a América Latina en los doce meses previos para hablar en conferencias en casi todas las naciones de América Latina. Organizó seis partidos de futbol en seis estadios con seleccionados y otros de los mejores equipos de futbol, bendiciendo a decenas de miles de niños. Alexis Median compartió con toda la concurrencia el impacto del entrenamiento de diez días en Uruguay realizado con un maestro de Tae Kwan Do y preparación intensiva de jóvenes de diferentes denominaciones. e. Orando juntos por la generación 4/14 Pastor In Soo Jung conecta con otros participantes en el congreso en intercesión a favor de la generación 4/14 anticipando el día 4/14 (abril 14) día de oración mundial a favor de los niños y pre jóvenes en la Ventana 4/14 alrededor del mundo uniéndose así también con hermanos en el Pacifico y Asia que ya inician el día 4 de abril. La oración fue en tres idiomas, español, coreano e ingles. Francisco Martinez de Colombia expresa solidaridad y agradecimiento a los representantes de la Alianza Coreana 4/14 recién formada por el compromiso de colaborar con la Iniciativa Latino Americana 4/14. (6) ¿Como romper las ataduras sobre los niños – Caso Concordia? Tomamos como ejemplo la ciudad de Concordia, que es un microcosmo de como se lleva adelante esta batalla spiritual, pero la situación es similar en toda América Latina. La historia de Concordia la define como una ciudad de acuerdos, cuando fue fundada fue ciudad de acuerdos. Existen evidencias de la actividad negativa sobre los niños tales como: pobreza infantil, violencia infantil, abandono y miseria, falta de educación, cultura pagana, e idolátrica. La cartografía espiritual demuestra una fuerte actividad demoniaca relacionada con las evidencias. Es evidente que existió un acuerdo entre Satanás y sus huestes incluyendo religiones afrobrasileñas (umbanda, macumba, kimbanda, vudú); San la muerte, brujerías; y el Gaucho Antonio Gil. Este acuerdo se revierte con un plan de acción que involucra a los siervos del Dios vivo y verdadero con oración e intercesión y acción práctica que incluye: a. un nuevo acuerdo entre los pastores, generando un clima de genuina unidad; b. orar con la autoridad de Cristo en lugares de autoridad. c. Equipar a la niñez y adolescencia, a través de jornadas, talleres, escuelas, para contrarrestar toda esta influencia nefasta e incursionar en todas las esferas de la sociedad. (7) ¿Cómo integrar herramientas para la transformación? Descubrimos que tenemos mas de 21 ONG&#39;s unidas a proveer herramientas en evangelismo (alcanzar), discipulado (formar)y servicio (comisionar). De estas compartieron cuatro en un taller incluyendo Soledad Rozas de OneHope, como uno de los 7 socios en evangelismo y Winston Fermin de Oansa, como uno de los 8 socios en el área de discipulado. Napoleon Ardaya compartió principios y valores de Jesús para la formación de liderazgo. Cirstina de AMO, Republica Dominicana compartió materiales de educación cristiana. La función de Leonel Espinoza como facilitador de la red de deportes también es IMPORTANTE destacar. Es pastor y capellán y es un gran enlace para este importante ministerio. Conclusión: En la conferencia Conexión de Nueva Generación reconocimos la vital importancia de géneros unidos en transformación. El anhelo de compartir recursos para alcanzar a cada esfera con los principios y valores de Jesús en cuanto a los niños resultóen búsqueda de modelos que inspiran y enseñan el como maximizar el impacto transformador del grupo 4/14. A Dios sea la gloria. Como resultado de la Conferencia Ventana 4-14 en Atlanta, y para colaborar en la construcción del cómo lograr la transformación mediante la inserción en las distintas esferas de la sociedad, se propone construir Mesa de Trabajo Latinoamericana Ventana 4/14. Esta mesa incluirá la comunicación y construcción de modelos a partir de aquellos que fueron presentados en conferencia, como así también aquellos que se sumen a esta propuesta, con la interacción correspondiente a fin de potenciar todas las herramientas posibles para la transformación de las nuevas generaciones, nucleadas en una Mesa de Trabajo Latinoamericana.

    "title": "A New Season of Korean-Hispanic Cooperation for the Sake of a New Generation",
    "content": "Serving | Catalyzing | Facilitating A New Season of Korean-Hispanic Cooperation for the Sake of a New Generation April 21, 2012 At the Latin American Regional 4/14 Window Conference held in Atlanta a new season of Korean-Hispanic cooperation is anticipated with the formation of the Korean 4/14 Window Alliance. &quot;This is a historic moment. We are experiencing an uplift in the 4/14 Initiative as a result of the synergy of the Latin Americans and Koreans evidenced by the formation of a Korean 4/14 Window Alliance,&quot; said Pastor Nam Soo Kim, host of the first two 4/14 Window Global Summits. The Korean 4/14 Alliance was formed spontaneously at the encouragement of Pastor James Jung, who hosted more than 400 participants from 24 countries at the Latin American Regional 4/14 Window Conference April 10-13 held in his church in Atlanta in partnership with two other churches. The purpose of the alliance was to connect with Korean pastors and leaders throughout the United States for collaboration with the Latin Americans in their efforts to raise up a new generation from the 4/14 Window to transform the world. The Latin American 4/14 Initiative regional facilitator, Ricardo Luna, who also serves as the President of CONELA, the Confraternity of Evangelical Churches of Latin America and OneHope, offered the participants perspective on generations connecting to transform nations and the nature of the challenge before us. He pointed out that, according to extensive research conducted around the world by OneHope, Latin America has become the most violent continent. The 4/14 Window Regional Conference theme Connecting New Generation focused on the how to more than the what of reaching, rescuing, equipping and enabling the 4/14ers of Latin America by connecting around emerging models in Latin America. We explored how to: respond to the challenge of violence in Latin America, develop a Strategic 4/14 Window Plan in a country, engage the spheres, especially media, education, church and family, conduct 4/14 week long intensive training sessions with Gen Y&#39;ers and 4/14ers to prepare them to change the culture of their nations, partner together as Korean and Latin American servants of God in responding to the 4/14 Window challenge in Latin America, engage in the spiritual battle for the hearts and minds of the 4/14ers, integrate the products and services offered by the NGO&#39;s. (1) How to respond to the challenge of violence in Latin America. The nature of the problem of violence and solutions offered by existing models in Latin America was explored by Luis Bush. As violence continues to increase, gangs grow and the average age of recruiting has dropped to more than one half of the entrants being from 12 to 14 years old, for which Luis proposed an intentional proactive preparation for child participation in peace processes throughout Latin America. Kids can make peace as has been well documented in the Majority World. Models of ways and means to prepare children to be peacemakers were presented from programs and projects of servant leaders from throughout Latin America that are highlighted in each of the remaining areas described in this report.

Click here to read more about howto respond to the challenge of violence in Latin America (English)2 (2) How to develop a Strategic 4/14 Window Plan for a country A delegation from Puerto Rico presented the strategic framework for a country or state 4/14 initiative: Vision: the primary focus of the church is raising a generation 4/14 to transform the world; Mission: Mobilizing the body of Christ to invest to reach, equip and mobilize the 4/14 generation and maximize their transformational impact; Networking for social change: parents and family, government, education, media and technology, and the church. Click here to read more about how to develop a Strategic 4/14 Window Plan (Spanish)3 (3) How to engage the spheres of cultural influence, especially media, education, church and family. In the sphere of government Juan Wehrli, the Minister of Religion from Chile, presented a historical model of shared principles and values material based on the Protestant Reformation and in response to a survey that was conducted in Chile on the beliefs and behaviors of young people. Wehrli is also a Lutheran pastor, theologian and historian. His book, Linea de Tiempo Historico, describes the role of education in transformation in Chile as he traces the realities of Protestantism in Chile at the present from the time of Jesus through the Reformation to the present. Today there exists the potential to reach 760 cultural centers in Chile to introduce principles and values from a Christian worldview as a result of a survey of beliefs, attitudes and behaviors of ten to eighteen year olds. In the area of public education in Chile there exists an opportunity to present lessons from the biblical worldview in the 900 public schools for two hours per week. Ivan Ruz along with Larry Fredes coordinates the work of 1,000 educators who teach religion classes required by law in schools in Chile. They are convinced that there are ways to do this in the different countries of Latin America worth pursuing. Models of schools established by churches to train a new group of 4/14ers were shared by Francisco Peña in Colombia, left and Lee de Leon, USA on the right below. In the sphere of media, Gaston Bruno, Vice President of the Association of Evangelicals of Argentina, insists that we must conquer the gadget screen in order to reach the 4/14 generation. At the Conference in Atlanta we considered a platform established in Bogota, Colombia that represents a strategic environment to support an effective and sustainable way to transform to reach the 4/14ers in their own language. The platform has three major components: the first are the antennas that identify the language used in most social networks, second an interdisciplinary team specializing in social media and third a modern infrastructure to disseminate millions of messages. Among internet users worldwide there are an estimated 800 million 4/14 year olds online which represents over 60% of the 4/14 Window worldwide. We recognized that we need to establish appropriate protocols to offer these resources to other Latin American nations. The importance of media is underscored by the fact that children and youth in the 4/14 age bracket in Latin America listen to music twenty six hours a week on average. The music video done both in English and Spanish entitled Heart of the Harvest by John Ray (johnray_morales@yahoo.com) not only connects with the generation but also carries the vision of the 4/14 Initiative. In the sphere of the Church the case study of a church in the city of Yopal, in the state of Casanare in the country of Colombia, was presented by Pastor Alfredo Moreno pastor of a three thousand member church. Several years ago, when the church was much smaller, one day a group of preteens in church said to him. &quot;Stop trying to entertain us in Sunday School. Teach us how we can have a meaningful relationship with Christ and be used by him.&quot; Pastor Alfredo Moreno took their word seriously. He began watching out for those youngsters who demonstrated real interest in the teaching of the Bible and meeting with them to train them. Today there are fifty three preteens and early teens that are being trained. They take an active role in the ministry to children where 700 come each week to children&#39;s church. He meets with the group of 53 each week for prayer, planning and study for ministry. They also are reaching their own age group and having Bible studies with them in small groups throughout the city. Yopal has become a comparatively safe city in Colombia and the media is beginning to ask why. (4)How to conduct camps and intensive courses? Transforming Nations-Discipling the 4/14 Generation is is the name given to the curriculum used for an eight day intensive training of 4/14ers usually conducted in a camp setting. Yarley Nino and Lyssette Ruiz developed the curriculum which has already been implemented in camps in Hong Kong, Colombia, Panama, Nicaragua and Puerto Rico with transformational impact. By understanding the spiritual capacity of children, our ministry completely changed the approach by prioritizing on the discipleship of children, adolescents and youth. One of the most valuable tools to achieve this has been through residential camps using the curriculum that integrates the fundamentals of Christian faith with the biblical worldview and the cultural mandate to go and serve and bring transformation to the spheres of cultural influence that shape a society: family, church, government, media, education, economy, health and science. We hope to continue multiplying in different countries of the world.. (Lyssette Ruiz lyssetterd@gmail.com) [Click to receive the English version of the curriculum]4 (5). How do Korean and Hispanic servants of God collaborate to raise up a new generation from the 4/14 Window to transform the world? a. Praying for the blessing of God on their lives, ministry and the shared mission of reaching the new generation. Eliodoro Mora, superintendent of the Assemblies of God in Venezuela, asks for God&#39;s blessing as Ben Hur, Korean pastor of Promise Church in Atlanta and co-sponsor of the event, receives the blessing. b. Worshipping God together expresses the unity of spirit. c. Celebrating a new generation from the 4/14 Window together d. Serving one another as did Dr. Eun Moo Lee, the facilitator of the event who labored for many months and many hours to prepare everything for the event. Pastor Nam Soo Kim has traveled many times to Latin America in the twelve months leading up to speak at conferences in almost all Latin American nations. He organized six football games in six different stadiums throughout Central America along with other top soccer teams, blessing tens of thousands of children. Alexis Medina reported on the significant impact of these ten days of intensive training of Gen Yers in Uruguay by a core team of Koreans including a master of Tae Kwan Do. e. Praying together for the 4/14 generation Pastor James connected with other conference participants in intercession for the generation 4/14 on 4/14 (April 14). This was a global day of prayer for children and youth in the 4/14 Window joining with others in the Pacific and Asia who had already started their day on April 4. Prayers were spoken in English, Spanish and Korean. f. Giving thanks to one another Francisco Martinez of Colombia at the pulpit expresses gratitude to the representatives of the Korean 4/14 Window Alliance (standing on the right) which has newly formed by the commitment to work with the Latin American 4/14 Window Initiative as demonstrated in the past, experienced in the present and anticipated in the future. (6) How to engage in the spiritual battle for the lives the 4/14ers –a case study of Concordia We take as an example of how to engage in the spiritual battle for the lives of the 4/14ers the case study of the city of Concordia, which is a microcosm of many other places in Latin America. It is located two and a half hours from where my paternal grandfather, Oscar Smedberg Bush, was born on June 26, 1890 in the city of Gualeguaychú in the province of Entre Rios. Concordia&#39;s history reveals the magnitude of the battle for the lives of the children. For years Ligia Würfel, communication&#39;s director for the Alliance of Evangelical Churches in Argentina, has served the children with her parents. The evidences of battle over the children in the city were described one by one as Doris and I had dinner with her and her father on November 29, 2011 following an official 4/14 Summit hosted by the mayor&#39;s office in the government municipal building. Ligia had made a study of the history of the city and saw the evidences of struggle over the lives of the children. This included children such as child poverty, child violence, neglect and poverty, lack of education, pagan and idolatrous worship in the city. She discovered overt demonic activity related to the evidence by such things as pilgrimages to shrines of Gauchito Gil on roadsides. Ligia identified and documented a host of Afro-Brazilian religions including Umbanda, macumba, kimbanda, and voodoo, San la muerte and Gaucho Gil. &quot;Gauchito&quot; Gil is thought to be a folk saint for many people who visit his shrine to ask for favors. The name Concordia in Spanish means &quot;the place where agreements are made.&quot; The children are the primary victims of the misfortunes of life in Concordia. In recent years there has been a definite reversal as God&#39;s servants have come together in unity as we saw expressed in the gathering at the Municipality on November 29. They joined together to pray over the city and for agreement that God&#39;s Kingdom would come to Concordia and his will be done in the city as it is in heaven. They also developed an action plan focused on the children. A new agreement has been made between the pastors, generating a climate of genuine unity. Prayer with spiritual authority has been lifted up in places of authority. Children are being served, educated, and equipped through schooling, Christian workshops, Saturday afternoon concentrations of children and intentional engagement in the spheres of influence in the city. In the process Ligia has been granted the position in the municipal government to make the decision on funding projects throughout the city. The spiritual atmosphere has changed in Concordia that benefits the next generation directly. (7) How to integrate the tools and products for reaching, rescuing, and equipping the 4/14ers to become change agents We found over 21 NGOs that came together to provide power and resource tools for evangelism (reaching), rescuing, discipleship (training) and service ministry. Of these NGO&#39;s, four shared a workshop including: Soledad Rozas from OneHope and one of 7 partners in evangelism; Winston Fermin de Oansa, one of 8 partners in the area of discipleship; Napoleon Ardaya of Bolivia shared leadership principles from the life of Christ; and Crisitina Rodriguez, AMO, Republica Dominicana shared a model for teachers training. Leonel Espinoza as facilitator of the sports network is also worth noting. He is a pastor and chaplain with influence among the athletes. Conclusion:The New Generation Connection conference recognized the vital importance of generational transformation. The desire to share resources to reach every arena based on the principles and values taught and modeled by Jesus as it relates to the children resulted in sharing models that inform, inspire and instruct how to maximize the transformative impact of the group 4/14. As a result of the 4/14 Window Conference in Atlanta there is a new sense of commitment to one another and between Koreans and Hispanics to engage in collaboration to bring about transformation through the involvement in and training of a new generation for their making a difference in the different spheres of cultural influence in society.

    "content": "Serving | Catalyzing | Facilitating Press Release April 14, 2012 Global Day of Prayer for the 4/14ers Introduction: On this 14th day of the 4th month of 2012 God&#39;s people around the world have been called to meet the challenge of the 4/14 Window through united fervent, focused, prayer and fasting. So much is at stake. So much is on the table. Let us come to the table together from wherever we are as we join our hearts with God&#39;s heart for the children of the world. On the table we find the Shewbread from the Word of God Deut 33:26 &quot;There is no one like the God of Jeshurun, who rides on the heavens to help you and on the clouds in his majesty.&quot; The Promise of Abundance—We have the Liberty of Access-- Joshua 21:45 Not one of all the Lord&#39;s good promises to the house of Israel failed; everyone was fulfilled. Ps 45:16 Your sons will take the place of your fathers; you will make them princes throughout the land. Ez 8:23-24 &quot;The gracious hand of our God is on everyone who looks to him… So we fasted and petitioned our God about this, and he answered our prayer.&quot; Mat 18:5 Jesus said: &quot;Whoever receives one such child in my name receives me.&quot; Today we receive Jesus as we receive the 1.2 billion children of the 4/14 Window as our call to prayer. On the table we find an expectation birthed in the hearts of God&#39;s people around the world called the 4/14 Window initiative. Our prayers today for the 4/14 Window focus on these expectations becoming reality. The 4/14 Window initiative represents is an urgent appeal to consider the potential and strategic importance of those 1.2 billion children and youth in the 4/14 Window. Pray God&#39;s people to hear! The vision of the 4/14 Window Movement is for the church to make the children the priority focus in their churches. Pray that pastors, elders, bishops and church leaders will wake up to the need to make the children the priority focus in their churches. The 4/14 Window initiative seeks to reach this most receptive generation to transform the world. Pray that the gospel be presented to every one of the 1.2 billion 4/14ers through parents, siblings, other 4/14ers, the churches – the story of Jesus booklet, the Jesus Film for children and through the Internet, the Wordless book and every way. The 4/14 Window initiative represents a global effort to rescue the 4/14 Window children. Pray for wholistic child development in the contexts of need in the nations through every church and NGO including Compassion International and World Vision. The 4/14 Window initiative involves mobilizing the 4/14ers as agents for transformation throughout the world. Pray for children to be mobilized as intercessors including the final remaining group of the 20,000 children intercessors that are been trained to interceded who are scheduled to come together on May 17th in the stadium in Jakarta as part of the World Prayer Assembly. The vision of the 4/14 Window Movement seeks to maximize their transformational impact while they are young, and mobilize them for continuing impact for the rest of their lives. Pray for wisdom by God&#39;s people in every nation on the need for and the how to maximize their transformational impact while they are young, and mobilize them for continuing impact for the rest of their lives. The vision of the 4/14 Window Movement seeks to raise them up with a Christian worldview. Pray for the impartation and reception of a biblical Christian world view for the 4/14ers that will result in them seeking s first the Kingdom of God and becoming Kingdom minded and develop a Kingdom mindset. The 4/14 Window initiative seeks to raise up a new generation from this most receptive generation to transform the world. Pray for Change agents God&#39;s way from the 4/14 generation to be raised up. On the table we find a battle raging for the children and youth of the 4/14 Window from our World today. The greatest battle going on in our day is the battle for the hearts and minds of men and women. The frontline of that battle is the age group (4-14) Jesus said the thief comes to steal, to kill, and to destroy I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly. A priority focus for Jesus and Satan are the children. It is a Bloody Battlefield today. The 4/14ers of the world are being trafficked as sex slaves, made to fight the wars started by the adults, abandoned to fend for themselves on the streets of the cities, struggling in the midst of extreme poverty, ignored by their own fathers, suffering due to divorce of the parents. In Honduras 70% are raised by single mothers. Lives are being cut off my our own human hands even before they make it out of their mothers&#39; wombs through abortion -- approximately 42 Million around the world every single year. 83% of all abortions are obtained in developing countries and 17% occur in developed countries. We excuse ourselves by calling it therapeutic abortion and then define it to include the loss of On the table we find seven basic challenges to maximize their transformational impact The Spiritual Challenge The Mental / Cognitive Challenge The Physical / Health Challenge The Economic Challenge The Relational Challenge The Social Challenge The Ministry Challenge On the table we find the future of Christianity 4/14ers are the heart of the harvest, Wess Stafford During this decade or &#39;window&#39; most children in this demographic group develop their moral foundations and values It is crucial that we re-prioritize and re-direct mission efforts toward those in the 4/14 Window. We are engaging the next generation of 4/14ers with a view of their transforming the world. The ultimate goal - To equip them to become partners with God on His transformational mission of bringing together all things under the headship of Christ (Eph. 1:9-10) with the result that all things on earth are reconciled and aligned to Him (Col. 1:20). Conclusion: Chuck Colson wrote: The great need of our day is to fuel a movement to equip believers to nurture Christian transformation in minds, lives, relationships, ministries, and spheres of influence around the world. And who should be at the forefront of that movement? The leaders of tomorrow - orthodox believers ages 4-14 firmly rooted in a faith that propels them to be the hands and feet of Christ. … it&#39;s more critical than ever to focus our efforts on reaching this generation.",

Tenemos tanto sobre la mesa. Vamos a venir a la mesa juntos desde donde estemos cuando unimos nuestros corazones con el corazón de Dios a favor de los niños del mundo. Sobre la mesa se encuentra el pan de la proposición de la Palabra de Dios Deuteronomio 33:26 No hay nadie como el Dios de Jesurún, que para ayudarte cabalga en los cielos, entre las nubes, con toda su majestad. Josué 21:45 Ni una sola de las admirables promesas que el Señor había hecho cayó en el vacío: todas se cumplieron. Salmo 45:16 En lugar de tus padres estarán tus hijos, a quienes harás príncipes en toda la tierra. Esdras 8:23-24 Ayunamos, pues, y pedimos a nuestro Dios acerca de esto; y él nos fue propicio. Mat 18:5 Jesús dijo: &quot;Y cualquiera que en mi nombre reciba a un niño como éste, a mí me recibe.&quot; Hoy recibimos a Jesús al recibir los 1,2 millones de niños de la Ventana 4/14 como nuestra llamada a la oración En la mesa nos encontramos con la expectativa naciente en los corazones del pueblo de Dios en todo el mundo a favor de la iniciativa de la Ventana 4/14. Es nuestra esperanza que estas peticiones sean contestadas y se transformen en realidad. La Ventana 4/14 representa un llamado urgente a considerar la importancia potencial y estratégico de los 1,2 millones de niños y jóvenes en la ventana 4/14. ¡Ore que el pueblo de Dios para escuche! La visión del Movimiento de 4/14 de la ventana es para la iglesia para que los niños tengan la atención prioritaria en sus iglesias. Ore para que pastores, ancianos, obispos y líderes de la iglesia se despiertan a la necesidad de que los niños precisan la atención prioritaria en sus iglesias. La iniciativa de la Ventana 4/14 busca alcanzar esta generación que es la más receptiva a transformar el mundo. Ore para que el evangelio se presente a cada uno de los 1.2 mil millones de niños a través de los padres, hermanos, otros de su edad, el librito la iglesia, la historia de Jesús libro, la película de Jesús para los niños ya través de Internet, el libro sin palabras y de toda forma. La iniciativa de la Ventana 4/14 representa un esfuerzo mundial para rescatar a los niños de la Ventana 4/14. Ore para que el desarrollo integro infantil en las naciones a través de todas las iglesias y las ONG como Compasión International y Visión Mundial. La iniciativa de la Ventana 4/14 implica la movilización de los niños como agentes de transformación en todo el mundo. Ore para que los niños se movilizarán como intercesores entre ellos. La visión del Movimiento 4/14 Ventana busca maximizar su impacto transformador mientras son jóvenes, y movilizarlos para continuar ese impacto el resto de sus vidas. Oren por la sabiduría de Dios para su pueblo en todas las naciones cómo maximizar su impacto transformador mientras son jóvenes, y movilizarlos para continuar con el impacto para el resto de sus vidas. La visión del Movimiento de la Ventana 4/14 trata de criarlos con una cosmovisión cristiana del mundo. Oremos por la impartición y recepción de una cosmovisión cristiana bíblica para los niños que resultará en buscar primeramente el Reino de Dios y se convertirá en una mentalidad del Reino. La iniciativa Ventana 4/14 pretende levantar una nueva generación de esta generación más receptivos a transformar el mundo. Oremos por los agentes de cambio, que se levantarán de la Ventana 4/14. En la mesa nos encontramos con una batalla que se libera sobre los niños y jóvenes de la Ventana 4/14 de nuestro mundo de hoy La batalla más grande ocurre en nuestros días es la batalla por los corazones y las mentes de los hombres y mujeres. La primera línea de esa batalla es el grupo de edad (4-14) Jesús dijo que el ladrón viene a robar, matar y destruir yo he venido para que tengan vida, y para que la tengan en abundancia. Un objetivo prioritario para Jesús y Satanás son los niños. Se trata de un sangriento campo de batalla hoy en día. Los niños de la Ventana 4/14 en el mundo son objeto de esclavitud sexual, abandonados a su suerte en las calles de las ciudades, luchando en medio de la pobreza extrema, ignorado por sus propios padres, sufrimiento debido al divorcio de los padres. En Honduras, el 70% son criados por madres solteras. Vidas están siendo cortadas por nuestras propias manos humanos, incluso antes nacer a través del aborto - aproximadamente 42 millones en todo el mundo cada año. 83% de todos los abortos se obtienen en los países en desarrollo y 17% ocurren en los países desarrollados. Nos disculpamos al llamarlo aborto terapéutico. En la mesa encontramos con siete retos básicos para maximizar su impacto transformacional El desafío espiritual El Desafío Mental / Cognitivo El reto físico / salud El desafío económico El desafío relacional El desafío social El Desafío del Ministerio Sobre la mesa se encuentra el futuro del cristianismo Los niños de la Ventana 4/14 son el corazón de la cosecha, Wess Stafford Durante esta década o &quot;Ventana&quot; la mayoría de los niños en este grupo demográfico desarrolla sus fundamentos morales y sus valores Es crucial priorizar y reorientar los esfuerzos de la misión hacia los de la Ventana 4/14. Estamos involucrando la próxima generación de los niños de la Ventana 4/14 con el propósito de la transformación del mundo. El objetivo final - a fin de prepararlos para convertirse en socios de Dios en su misión de transformación de reunir todas las cosas bajo el señorío de Cristo (Efesios 1:9-10) con el resultado de que todas las cosas de la tierra se reconcilien a él (Col. 1:20). Conclusión: Chuck Colson escribe: &quot;La gran necesidad de nuestros días es el de impulsar un movimiento para equipar a los creyentes para fomentar la transformación cristiana de las mentes, vidas, relaciones, ministerios y esferas de influencia en todo el mundo. ¿Y quién debería estar a la vanguardia de ese movimiento? Los líderes del mañana, de entre los creyentes de la Ventana 4/14 firmemente arraigados en la fe que les impulsa a ser las manos y los pies de Cristo. ... es más importante que nunca centrar nuestros esfuerzos en alcanzar a esta generación.&quot;",

    "content": "Sirviendo | Catalizando | Facilitando Comienzo de la Coalición de Cosmovisión Cristiana de Estados Unidos Y La Ventana 4/14 3 de Abril de 2012 &quot;Dios Todopoderoso ha puesto delante de mí dos grandes objetivos: la supresión de la trata de esclavos y la reforma de la sociedad&quot;, escribió William Wilberforce, en el siglo 18 en Londres. Dios Todopoderoso ha puesto delante de Chuck Colson tres grandes objetivos en el siglo 21 en Lansdowne, cerca de Washington DC; la santidad de la vida humana, la dignidad del matrimonio tradicional y la libertad religiosa. En su día, un grupo de personas con ideas afines formaron el Círculo de Clapham. En nuestros días, un grupo de cincuenta y cinco Norteamericanos de ideas afines a los ciudadanos estadounidenses se reunieron para formar la Coalición de Cosmovisión Cristiana. Del pueblo Hispano Sammy Rodriguez de la Conferencia Nacional Cristiana Hispana y su servido estuvimos en el grupo. En su carta de invitación escrita el día 20 de enero de 2012 Chuck Colson escribió: Queremos una coalición que busca a Dios y cause un chispazo creando un movimiento entre su pueblo.&quot; El momento de la reunión para formar la Coalición Cosmovisión Cristiana el 30 de marzo coincidió con la presentación de la Declaración de Manhattan, firmada por más de 550.000 estadounidenses de ideas afines. Esta Declaración fue entregada al Presidente de los EE.UU. tres días después, el 2 de abril. La Declaración de Manhattan es una declaración no partidista con afirmación de líderes espirituales y seguidores de Cristo de los EE.UU. en defensa de la vida humana, el matrimonio tradicional y la libertad religiosa. A través de ella se ha trazado una línea en la arena&quot; - declarando que estamos dispuestos a dar al César lo que es del César, pero bajo ninguna circunstancia daremos al César lo que pertenece a Dios. Al mismo tiempo, la visión de la Coalición de Cosmovisión Cristiana no tiene por objetivo promover una agenda política específica, ni una ideología, ni apoya a ningún partido o candidato. Tampoco hay intención de crear otra organización, sino más bien empezar como una red informal con la esperanza de que se conduzca un movimiento del pueblo de Dios comprometido con vivir y defender la Cosmovisión Cristiana. La visión de la Coalición es de creyentes que sirven en iglesias renovadas para avivar a sus comunidades y cultura y así avanzar el Reino de Dios. El objetivo de la Coalición no es imponerse sobre los miembros, sino más bien tratar de proponer maneras de trabajar juntos, animarnos unos a otros, compartir las mejores prácticas y ampliar el impacto que cualquiera de nosotros podemos tener si lo hacemos a solas. Las actividades incluyen la oración, la búsqueda de consenso sobre cuestiones claves en la cultura, la colaboración en cada esfera de influencia cultural, el establecimiento de una plataforma tecnológica e indicadores de progreso. Los valores de la coalición son en primer lugar la oración - esto debe ser de Dios no de nosotros, en segundo lugar, la colaboración - no competencia, en tercer lugar, la humildad – liderar sirviendo, y en cuarto lugar, el respeto mutuo - cada uno tiene sus propios dones y llamado. Durante una sesión interactiva de la reunión del 30 de marzo los participantes fueron encuestados para buscar consenso sobre la manera de entablar la Coalición de Cosmovisión Cristiana. Resumiendo el criterio del grupo fue de formar una coalición con una base amplia, con vistas a largo plazo, sin mucha estructura enfatizando tanto la oración como también la acción. La necesidad de un enfoque estratégico a largo plazo me hizo pensar sobre la importancia de un enfoque prioritario sobre la Ventana 4/14. George Barna señala que: Cuando la mayoría de los estadounidenses llegan a la edad de trece a catorce años, ellos piensan que ya saben todo lo que es de valor que la Biblia tiene para enseñar y que ya no están interesados en aprender más contenido de las Escrituras. Se requiere un esfuerzo cada vez más conciso, creativo, y personalmente pertinente para penetrar las mentes con nuevas ideas, o más preciso en los principios genuinamente bíblicos.&quot; La analogía más cercana de la Coalición de Cosmovisión Cristiana es el movimiento relacionado con el Círculo de Clapham formado por William Wilberforce y muchos otros a finales del siglo 18 en Londres. Es un modelo para involucrar al pueblo y la transformación del mundo que se llevó a cabo en ese momento por la catalización de la abolición del mal trato de esclavos en el Imperio Británico con la Ley de Trata de Esclavos de 1807. Aun así todavía había esclavos blancos en Inglaterra - en referencia a los niños que fueron obligados a trabajar doce horas al día o más en las fábricas en Londres - que continuaron hasta que esta practica fue parada por las leyes del parlamento en 1875. Fue gracias al enfoque estratégico a largo plazo de Robert Raikes de levantar una nueva generación de la Ventana 4/14 para transformar la nación. Robert Raikes, un propietario de un periódico, comenzó la escuela dominical para los niños y jóvenes que estaban fuera de la iglesia. Robert sabía que el futuro era sombrío para estos niños que tenían que trabajar todo el tiempo sin ninguna esperanza de recibir una educación. Lo que es peor, sin haber quien les enseñe las buenas nuevas del Evangelio, o cómo vivir el camino de Dios. Raikes decidió hacer algo acerca de los desafíos que enfrentan en Inglaterra mediante la creación de escuelas para los niños. La transformación de Gran Bretaña había comenzado, y proseguiría a través del siglo 19. A finales de 1900 el 85% de los niños en Inglaterra estaban asistiendo a la Escuela Dominical. Chuck Colson ha reconocido la necesidad y la oportunidad de centrarse en un largo plazo estratégica cuando escribió lo siguiente. La gran necesidad de nuestros días es el de impulsar un movimiento para equipar a los creyentes para fomentar la transformación cristiana de las mentes, vidas, relaciones, ministerios y esferas de influencia en todo el mundo. ¿Y quién debería estar a la vanguardia de ese movimiento? Los líderes del mañana, los creyentes de 4 a 14 años firmemente arraigados en la fe actuando como las manos y los pies de Cristo. Por tanto es más importante que nunca centrar nuestros esfuerzos en alcanzar a esta generación.&quot; Hoy día existe una necesidad urgente de renovación de nuestra cultura en los Estados Unidos. La Iglesia ha sido intimidada y silenciada. Tenemos que levantarnos y alzar nuestra voz para romper el silencio. Estamos proponiendo trabajar juntos para lograr la visión como creyentes que servimos en iglesias renovadas para bendición de nuestra comunidad y cultura y el avance del Reino de Dios. Hoy es el día. Este es el momento de también levantar una nueva generación de la Ventana 4/14 para transformar nuestros países. Luis y Doris",

    "title": "Christian Worldview Coalition USA Kickoff",
    "content": "Serving | Catalyzing | Facilitating Christian Worldview Coalition USA Kickoff April 3, 2011 &quot;God Almighty has set before me two great objects: the suppression of the slave trade and the Reformation of society&quot; wrote William Wilberforce in the late 18th century in London. God Almighty has set three great objects before Chuck Colson in the early 21st century in Lansdowne, near Washington DC; the sanctity of human life, the dignity of traditional marriage and religious liberty. In his day Wilberforce and like-minded people formed the Clapham Circle. In our day, a group of fifty five like-minded US citizens met to form the Christian Worldview Coalition. Both then and now the initiatives focused on renewing the culture of the day. In his letter of invitation written January 20, 2012 Chuck Colson wrote: &quot;We desire a coalition seeking God to give a spark that will make a movement of His people possible.&quot; Recognizing that prayer plays a central role in the coalition, one of the goals of the coalition is to partner with prayer ministries. One of the people sitting at the table was Billy Wilson who represented one of those prayer initiatives in the U.S. called Awakening America Alliance, with the expressed purpose of increasing awareness of the deep spiritual need in today&#39;s America and to pursue a new Christ awakening in our nation that will impact our world. The timing of the meeting to form the Christian Worldview Coalition on March 30 coincided with the presentation of the Manhattan Declaration, signed by over 550,000 like-minded Americans to the U.S. President three days later on April 2nd. The Manhattan Declaration is a non-partisan statement of conscience affirmed by spiritual leaders of Christ followers in the U.S. in defense of human life, traditional marriage and religious freedom. It represents a &quot;line in the sand&quot; – a statement by the people who signed it – that we are happy to give to Caesar what belongs to Caesar, but under no condition will we give to Caesar what belongs to God. At the same time, the Christian Worldview Coalition does not seek to advocate a specific political agenda or ideology and will not endorse any particular party or candidate. Nor is there intention to create another organization but rather start as an informal network in the hope that it leads to a movement of God&#39;s people committed to living and defending the Christian worldview. The vision of the Coalition is of revived believers serving in renewed churches for the greater awakening of their neighbors, our culture, and society to the Good News of the Kingdom of God. The Good News of the Kingdom of God is what the Coalition seeks – as drafted by T.M. Moore – in a document titled: What We Seek: A Kingdom Manifesto. The goal of the Coalition is not to impose policy or direction of the members but rather seek to propose ways to work together, encourage each other, share best practices and amplify the impact that any of us can have working alone. The activities include prayer, consensus seeking on key issues in culture, collaboration in each sphere of cultural influence, establishing a technology platform and indicators of progress. The values of the coalition are first of all prayerful – this must be God&#39;s will not ours; second, collaborative – not competing; third, winsome – not shrill; fourth, humble – servant leadership and fifth, respectful – each has our own gifts and calling. During an interactive session of the meeting on March 30 the participants were polled on the approach to implementation of the Christian Worldview Coalition. For each of the four options it was like a balancing act (see figure on the right). The group was inclined toward unstructured versus structured, long-term strategic versus short-term tactical, broad focus versus narrow focus and even on prayer versus activism. The comprehensive conviction of the group was to form a broad based, long-term, loosely designed coalition. The question arose, could this kind of coalition function without strong leadership at the top? The need for a long-term strategic focus caused me to think about the importance of a priority focus on the 4/14 Window during their formation years. George Barna notes that: &quot;By the time most Americans reach the age of 13 or 14, they think they pretty much know everything of value the Bible has to teach and they are no longer interested in learning more scriptural content. It requires increasingly concise, creative, reinforced, and personally relevant efforts to penetrate people&#39;s minds with new or more accurate insights into genuinely biblical principles.&quot;1 The closest analogy for the Christian Worldview Coalition is the movement related to the Clapham Circle formed by William Wilberforce and many others in late 18th century London. It is a model for engaging secularism and transforming the world which was accomplished at that time by catalyzing the abolition of the slave trade in the British Empire with the Slave Trade Act of 1807. Even then there were still white slaves in England – referring to the children who were made to work twelve hours a day or longer in the mills and sweatshops in London – which continued until this was stopped by acts of parliament in 1875. It was thanks to the long term strategic focus of Robert Raikes to raise up a new generation from the 4/14 Window to transform the nation. Robert Raikes, a newspaper proprietor, started schools on Sunday that launched the Sunday School Movement for those from outside of the church. &quot;Robert knew that the future was grim for these children who had to work all the time with no hope of an education. &quot;Worse yet, with no one to teach them the good news of the Gospel or how to live God&#39;s way.&quot;2 Raikes decided to do something about the challenges faced in the UK by setting up schools for children. The transformation of Britain had begun, and it was to continue right through the 19th Century. It would transform the spiritual condition of the country. By the end of 1900 85% of the children in the UK attended Sunday School. Chuck Colson has recognized the need and opportunity for a long term strategic focus on the 4/14 generation. &quot;The great need of our day is to fuel a movement to equip believers to nurture Christian transformation in minds, lives, relationships, ministries, and spheres of influence around the world. And who should be at the forefront of that movement? The leaders of tomorrow – orthodox believers ages 4-14 firmly rooted in a faith that propels them to be the hands and feet of Christ. … it&#39;s more critical than ever to focus our efforts on reaching this generation.&quot;3 We agree with the summary statement of January 28, 2012 for the proposed Christian Worldview Coalition. &quot;There is an urgent need for revival and renewal in our world today. The Church has been cowed into a Spiral of Silence – we need to stand up and speak out to break the spiral. We are proposing to work together to bring about the vision of revived believers serving in renewed churches for the greater awakening of their neighbors, our culture, and society to the Good News of the Kingdom of God. The time is now.&quot; References http://www.barna.org/barna-update/article/12-faithspirituality/325-barna-studies-the-research-offers-a-year-in-review-perspective http://www.christianity.com/churchhistory/11635043/ The 4/14 Window: Raising up a New Generation to Transform the World. http://www.amazon.com/The-14-Window-Generation-Transform/dp/0984116907",

Like the orphan Queen Esther was uniquely positioned to make a difference in her day, so YWAM is in our day. The key biblical reference, Esther 4:14 matches the 4/14 Movement not only in the numbers 4/14 but also in the motif. Mentor Mordecai challenged the orphan queen with the words &quot;for who knows but that you have come to royal position for such a time as this?&quot;1 There was a window of opportunity then to change the world at the time of Esther. So there is a window of opportunity today to change the world: the 4/14 Window. God has divine purposes to accomplish in this world through people at appointed times. For Esther, the orphan who had become queen, the word came from her uncle, &quot;Perhaps you have come to royal position for such a time as this,&quot; Esther 4:14. There are several reasons to believe that Youth With a Mission (YWAM) prioritizing missional focus on the 4/14 Window could make a difference in our time. As servant catalysts in the 4/14 Movement, Doris and I readily responded to the invitation from our friends, Jim and Judy Orred, to come to Kona to bring focus on the 4/14 Window for the weekly &#39;Ohana Gathering&#39; meeting. On March 15, this meeting comprised around 600 staff and students from 47 nations, as well as family and guests from abroad and the local community. Jim chairs the YWAM Kona leadership team. As we heard the heart of YWAM co-founders, Loren and Darlene Cunningham, and many others serving at the YWAM base in Kona we became increasingly convinced that YWAM has a unique catalytic contribution to make to the 4/14 Global Initiative to raise up a new generation from the 4/14 Window to transform the world. In fact, we see that YWAM could have been raised up to the position it has today as the largest long-term mission agency in the world today operating from more than 600 bases with an additional 800 locations where university registered courses are taught totaling 1400 operating locations with more than 25,000 full time missionaries engaged in training, mercy ministries and evangelism. At the &#39;Ohana Gathering Luis shared from Joel 2:28 as quoted by the Apostle Peter on the Day of Pentecost &quot;In the last days, God says, I will pour out my Spirit on all people. Your sons and daughters will prophesy, your young men will see visions, your old men will dream dreams.&quot;2 The 4/14ers will play a major role in global mission in the end times, expounding God&#39;s view and end-visioning the future with the help of the Holy Spirit and generational links. &quot;As the founders of Youth with a Mission--this ever-expanding global ‘movement of ministry organizations,&#39; which has reached into every nation, Loren and Darlene Cunningham embody Joel 2:28 as generational links to a mighty emerging movement of the Holy Spirit in and through a younger generation. Prophesy is all about bringing God&#39;s viewpoint to earthly matters.&quot; Luis noted that one of those young men was a 21 year old--in fact when he was 20--he saw a vision--while traveling in the Bahamas--of waves on the shorelines of the continents on a world map, growing bigger and bigger, covering the landmass which changed from waves to young people covering the continents talking to people about their faith. That young person was Loren Cunningham. Youth with a Mission was born shortly after. As we listened to the co-founders, elders, department and project leaders and day by day decision makers there was a growing awareness in our hearts and minds that God is up to something and it is the raising up of YWAM for such a time as this to reach, rescue, root in God&#39;s Word and raise up a new generation from the 4/14 Window to transform the world for the following reasons: Call and Recall Missional Ministry to the Children Priority Focus Media Ministry Highway to the Culture of the 4/14ers of our Day YWAM Intercession for the 4/14 Window in the Personal Prayer Diary for 2012 Justice Advocacy Attracts the 4/14ers Infusion Integrating Incoming 4/14ers and Youth Increases King&#39;s Kids Connection Seven Spheres Curriculum Catalyze 4/14ers to Maximize their Transformational Impact Future Fusion Fueled by Circles, Cycles, Circuits &amp; Omega Zones I. Call and Recall Missional Ministry to the Children Priority Focus Darlene Cunningham led the YWAM family gathering on March 15 and told the story about the calling she and Loren had received from God not only to minister to the children but also to prioritize missional focus on the children. &quot;This was the ethos at the beginning but through the years we lost this. Three years ago at the Global Leadership Forum, which took place in Fiji, after a time of prayer there was agreement as expressed by several people in the room, that the call had been forgotten and it was time to take it up again.&quot; That same morning Darlene had shared with us that she recalled that prayer time at the Global Leadership Forum in Fiji that God was speaking to us about conviction and correction. We need to pick up. It&#39;s time to issue a call to the YWAM family for priority focus of the 4/14ers with intentionality in every ministry of YWAM. These words that speak to the future were spoken with heart felt passion by Darlene. II. Media Ministry Highway to the Culture of the 4/14ers of our Day The Kony2012: Invisible Children video was viewed more than 80 million times in only thirteen days since it was uploaded to the Internet on March 5, 2012 (www.kony2012.com). It is a film and campaign by Invisible Children that aims to make Joseph Kony famous to raise support for his arrest. The Kony 2012 campaign sank under scrutiny soon after, but not before the video went viral like no other piece has ever done because it connected with the culture of our day and especially the youth. It was shown following the YWAM family gathering on March 15. In addition, the interview of Joseph Kony by YWAMer Sam Farmer, was shown. In fact, Sam Farmer is reported to be the only person known to interview Joseph Kony. One reason for that could well be the intentionality of YWAM&#39;s media ministry to be on the spot to tell the news. In so doing they not only influence the sphere of media but they also build a highway to the culture of our day through the media. Media is highly influential among the 4/14ers of today. They have increasingly become the focus of media advertising firms promoting their material products as well as places to eat and gambling in Macau. Media is the primary coping mechanism for stress among youth. The Internet is easily accessed. Directing the media ministry for YWAM David Cunningham, the son of Loren and Darlene, made many people stop and listen to a different point of view as a producer in Hollywood sometimes creating a stir in so doing (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_L._Cunningham). His film To End All Wars(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/To_End_All_Wars) performed well at several Film Festivals. When we met with Loren he asked the question: &quot;Did you hear about the grasshoppers?&quot; Indeed we had! David had explained to us the day before that the grasshoppers was the name for children of ten years old who were being trained to tell the news. At a time when there is more influence today among the youth though the media than through their own parents YWAM&#39;s media moves are building a communication highway to the next generation of leaders who will change the world. One of the new initiatives is the action comic on David due to go public around 4/14 (April 14) (http://www.lionofwar.com/new/motioncomic/). It will speak directly and dramatically to the truth told in the anchor verse of the 4/14 Movement, Psalm 8:2. &quot;Through the praise of children and infants you have established a stronghold against your enemies, to silence the foe and avenger.&quot; Why is this innovative media project so strategic to the 4/14 Initiative? When young David left the sheep following his father&#39;s orders, to bring gifts from home for his elder brothers, David sees Goliath defying the ranks of Israel and how all the Israelites ran away in great fear. He offers himself to fight the giant when he hears about this. Tall King Saul scolds the diminutive David, &quot;Don&#39;t be ridiculous!&quot; &quot;There&#39;s no way you can fight this Philistine and possibly win! You&#39;re only a boy.&quot; &quot;You are not able to go against this Philistine to fight with him; for you are only a boy.&quot; But, as we read in Psalm 8:2, God chose a boy from the 4/14 Window on whose lips he built a stronghold. God revealed it to David himself, the human author, in Psalm 8:2 &quot;In the lips of a child God established strength.&quot; Despite the fact that David was scorned by his own older brother, ridiculed by his own king, Saul of Israel, and mocked by the giant Goliath of Gad for only being a boy he won the battle against the Giant. III. YWAM Intercession for the 4/14 Window in the Personal Prayer Diary for 2012 In December 2011, Tom Bragg, Director of YWAM Publishing wrote: &quot;For over thirty years, YWAM Publishing has had the privilege of publishing the Personal Prayer Diary and Daily Planner. Currently, over 40,000 Christians worldwide join in God&#39;s work in the world through vital intercession for the nations using this comprehensive resource. For 2012, we are especially excited about our focus on the 4/14 Window.&quot; The Personal Prayer Diary and Daily Planner for 2012 incorporated &quot;The 4/14 Window: Raising Up a New Generation&quot; as anchor article. Likewise the Spanish and Portuguese editions by different publishers with distributions of 30,000 and 20,000, included the article and focus on the 4/14 Window. With so many tens of thousands interceding in the worldwide family of YWAM for the 4/14 Window in 2012 it would be within the realm of possibility that the vision and the burden to focus YWAM ministries of all kinds in all places on the 4/14 Window would emerge as an answer to prayer. YWAM, you have been raised up for such a time as this. As the 2012 Prayer Guide makes clear, we should prioritize our missional focus on the 4/14 Window because it is a vast unmobilized demographic ripe for the harvest. &quot;Every Christ follower in every community and nation—even children and youth—are called to involvement in Christ&#39;s transformational mission. In the Bible, 4/14ers like Samuel, David, Josiah, Esther, and Jeremiah were used by God to enact great transformation. Jesus Himself loved and used children in his ministry, such as the young boy with the five loaves and two fish (John 6:9). Jesus flipped the world&#39;s view upside-down: He saw children as the spiritual pacesetters for adults. They modeled what His Kingdom was all about. &quot;Truly, I say to you, whoever does not receive the kingdom of God like a child shall not enter it&quot; (Mark 10:15). IV. Justice Advocacy Creatively Attracts the 4/14ers Advocates for justice for children taps into the 4/14ers missional concern of today regardless of whether they are Christian or not. Human nature cares that its defenseless little ones are made slaves and forced to fight in armies over causes not their own, at the cost of their own lives. It expresses the heart of mission of Jesus as stated in Luke 4 to release the oppressed rooted in God&#39;s revelation from the book of Isaiah as in &quot;He will give justice to the poor,&quot; (Is. 11:4); in which as the servant &quot;He will bring justice to the nations,&quot; (Is. 42:1) and &quot;He will bring justice to all who have been wronged&quot; (Is. 42.3) and &quot;He will not falter or lose heart until justice prevails throughout the earth&quot; (Is. 42:4). Jesus stated mission included setting the captives free. In today&#39;s world an estimated twenty seven million human beings are kept as slaves, mainly in the sex trade and many of those children. PhotogenX is one of the creative means for advocating justice that appeals to all, including children. New Zealander Paul Childers, with his photographer wife Susie, has published books; a prayer guide for thirty days of prayer for the voiceless speaking on behalf of those cannot really speak for themselves. Seventy thousand copies of an English edition were printed with photographs calling the body of Christ to engagement in this same concern that was the passion of Jesus. (See interview at www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPUNSy1qurk) V. Infusion Integrating Incoming 4/14ers and Youth Increases YWAM&#39;s program called Infusion attracts thousands of thirteen to fourteen year olds for two weeks to tackle topics such as the Father&#39;s heart, Jesus is Lord, who the Holy Spirit is, and what living out the Kingdom looks like. Each year these 4/14ers join and integrate older teens seeking after God and His will for their lives. The older teens are those on the planet most able to positively influence the 4/14ers as they live in their culture and understand their language while being often regarded as heroes to the younger teens. Infusion speaks beyond a program to a reality of unprecedented growth of this ever-expanding global &quot;movement of ministry organizations,&quot; which has reached into every nation. Entering YWAM normally involves signing up for a DTS (Discipleship Training School) or other course in the largest non-formal university in the world called the University of the Nations. The screen on one wall in the Gateway shows the number of incoming students interested in coming to the Kona base to take a DTS course or some other course who are online (blue), pending acceptance (pink), to be interviewed (yellow) and accepted (green). Gateway and Crown (Christ Revealed on World Networks) Ministries led by Chong Ho Won, a former IT executive, along with a team of highly qualified people who have committed themselves as IT missionaries to provide a gateway to crowning ministries, have successfully gone from a paper office four months ago to a paperless picture perfect visual presentation of each person who enters the University of the Nations and training courses at YWAM&#39;s Kona location. The photograph, address and phone number for each of those who are accepted into one of YWAM&#39;s many programs flashes on the screen. Chong Ho Won told us that it reminds each person at Gateway and Crown Ministries that every person counts. Among other promptings for upgrading to this remarkable new system to track of people entry through the gateway committed to God&#39;s mission was a vision of 200,000 people coming for training to the University of the Nations for diverse Christian organizations on God&#39;s mission in the nations. YWAM leaders views themselves not as a mission organization or mission agency but rather an international movement of Christians from many denominations dedicated to presenting Jesus personally to this generation, to mobilizing as many as possible to help in this task, and to the training and equipping of believers for their part in fulfilling the Great Commission. As citizens of God&#39;s kingdom, called to love, worship, and obey our Lord, to love and serve His Body, the Church, and to present the whole Gospel for the whole person throughout the whole world. Several we talked with expressed anticipation that there is a fresh wave of people coming who want to prepare to serve among the nations. A university based mobile DTS is being prepared to train 25,000 students beginning in January 2013. There are a growing number of partnerships with other ministries such as the South Pacific partnership for the purpose of Bible translation and Call to All. VI. King&#39;s Kids Connection The largest of YWAM&#39;s Ministries is King&#39;s Kids International ministry which was launched thirty six years ago by Dale Kauffman and has grown in numbers and maturity. KKI / King&#39;s Kids International is a ministry of &quot;Youth With A Mission&quot; that serves in partnership with families, churches and other like-minded organizations. King&#39;s Kids is an international movement, embracing a Kingdom lifestyle that is family-based and generationally linked. The purpose of King&#39;s Kids is to care for, reach, equip and mobilize children, youth and families into their destiny of knowing God, bringing Him joy, making Him and His Kingdom known. They value relationship with God as a first priority by growing to know Him intimately and by bringing Him joy. They value discipleship training in the context of everyday life. They value the spiritual capacity and destiny of children, preteens and teenagers. They value the family and the linking of the generations. They value team leadership, networking and partnerships. They value a lifestyle of reaching out by making Jesus and His Salvation known to all peoples, serving in ways that can extend His Kingdom into all spheres of society worldwide. VII. Seven Spheres Curriculum Catalyze 4/14ers to maximize their transformational impact The development of a curriculum for 4/14ers to maximize their transformational impact in the seven spheres of cultural influence in society was worked by YWAM-King&#39;s Kids International leader Yarley Nino with Lyssette Ruiz titled: Transforming Nations – Discipling the 4/14 Generation. The curriculum is designed to transform nations through well trained 4/14ers. They seek to provide educational material based on Biblical Worldview of the spheres of cultural influence in society. Designed to be taught in a seven day camp the sessions are highly participatory giving Biblical foundations for entering each of the spheres of cultural influence in society. The training consists of topics such as: Christian character and the spiritual capacity of children and Self-Government based on the teachings of Dale Kauffman and missional goals per sphere of cultural influenced based on Landa Cope&#39;s Deuteronomy Template. (www.technoheaven.com/bi/zBI-Old Testament Template.doc) They are witnessing the work of the Holy Spirit bringing revival in the lives of children, adolescents, youth and adults in Panama and transformation of a community in Colombia. They have given the course in Hong Kong. VIII. Future Fusion Fueled by Circles, Cycles, Circuits &amp; Omega Zones As we met with Loren Cunningham for an hour at his home on March 17th we talked about the past for some time, then about the present including the vision for the release of children as change agents using the grasshoppers as an example. Then he shared his heart about the future of YWAM with reference to Circles, Cycles, and Circuits and then about Omega Zones. As he talked I saw a future involving the fusion of many ministries over many years fueled by intentional missional engagement in greater breadth and depth in and through Circles, Cycles, and Circuits and then about Omega Zones. These geographical units are called Omega zones because YWAM wants Jesus - who is the Alpha and Omega - to be known in every part of the earth. For more information link to http://4kworldmap.com. In our conversation he expressed a vision for a YWAM presence in every one of the Omega zones around the world. The picture of the circles, cycles, and circuits emerged the first morning after the YWAM 50th anniversary celebrations of 2010 ended. He talked to us in some detail the geographical layout of the circuits and need and plans for forty more naval vessels to use. In the 2011 Global Leadership Forum gathering Loren presented the vision as a way to steward the future growth of YWAM. &quot;John Dawson explains that Loren spoke about circles of purposeful relationship, which could include existing groupings within YWAM, such as mercy ministry or frontier missions, but could also include YWAMers working within the spheres, such as in the area of education. He also talked briefly about circuits of geography, and cycles of time. He said this three-fold model could allow for tremendous expansion of YWAM&#39;s ministry. The circles and circuits and cycles, they&#39;re going to enable us to multiply greatly.&quot; Conclusion: Youth With A Mission is positioned to enhance and energize the 4/14 Movement for such a time as this. Recent President of the Evangelical Fellowship of Mission Agencies, Paul McKaughan, who has served as a member of our accountability/support committee for more than twenty five years made this statement about YWAM in the mid-1990&#39;s: &quot;It is probably the most significant seed bed for leadership in the Christian movement today and indeed is the largest long term mission agency in the world. So many people of vision now in pastorates and other leadership positions have been impacted by and have come out of that ministry. It is this that makes YWAM one of, if not the most influential movement in our Christian world today. The question becomes can they sustain it as they mature in the 21st?&quot; In our view not only have they sustained their momentum but they have surpassed the expectations of years gone by. It is our conviction that prioritizing their missional focus on the 4/14 Window in the next phase of their ministry YWAM will maximize their positive transformational impact in the nations and omega zones of this world.

    "content": "Serving | Catalyzing | Facilitating 4/14 Window Movement in Africa March 14, 2012 The 4/14 Movement and the Awakening of the Sleeping Giant of French Speaking Africa Introduction:The first words uttered following dinner at a meeting of the Board of the Association of Evangelicals in Africa (AEA) and the 4/14 Window facilitators and servant catalysts by Chairman Samuel Yameogo were about the 4/14 Movement and the Awakening of the Sleeping Giant of French Speaking Africa. Over the next four days 750 participants gathered from Burkina Faso and fourteen of the twenty six countries in French speaking Africa the unfolding drama of an awakening giant became evident to the delegates in four scenes during our time together at the regional 4/14 Window conference for Francophone Africa. In scene one, we saw indications of a sleeping giant awakening. In scene two we received instruction about how the sleeping giant awakens. In scene three we considered an illustration of a sleeping giant awakening and in scene four we considered the implications of a sleeping giant awakening. Scene One: Indications of a sleeping giant awakening The announcement was made at the opening ceremony presided over by the President of the Federation of Churches and Missions (FEME) of Burkina Faso and chairman of AEA Samuel Yameogo as the children were looking over his shoulder: &quot;There is arising a sleeping giant in French speaking Africa,&quot; referring to those very 4/14ers. The facilitator of the 4/14 Movement in the Francophone countries, Jonas Robert Sawadogo said: &quot;this is a historic moment for our country. It is the beginning of a new era.&quot; Mario Li Hing (Executive Chair of AEA) from French speaking Mauritius noted that for the first time the chairman and general secretary of AEA are both French speaking. Aiah Foday-Khabenje, Association of Evangelicals in Africa, General Secretary from Sierra Leone said: &quot;The 4/14 Movement is a call for the church to place children in the way of God and His mission. That&#39;s what Jesus did. He put the child in the midst.&quot; President of the Assemblies of God of Burkina Faso, Michel Ouedraogo, said: &quot;Francophone Africa will no longer be the same. Children will be blessed. They will be included in the plan of God. The name of the Lord will be glorified.&quot; The facilitator of the 4/14 Movement for Africa, Shiferaw Michael said: &quot;The continent of Africa is ready. God is able to make a queen out of an orphan.&quot; The facilitator of the 4/14 Movement for Western Europe Harry said: &quot;What some refer to as the &#39;sleeping giant&#39; of Africa is waking up to a new awareness of God&#39;s heart for the children and the urgent need to make them a vital and permanent focus of the Church&#39;s prayers and action.&quot; Scene Two: Instruction about a sleeping giant awakening The seed planted in our minds during a presentation by Shiferaw Michael, the 4/14 Window facilitator for all of Africa coming from Ethiopia, communicated giant awakening thoughts for harnessing the potentials of the 4/14 Window for the transformation of French speaking Africa. The 4/14 Window Movement is a call to the church in Africa to start a new paradigm to see many trees in one fruit. We need to see many churches in a child. There is no greater mistake than seeing only a child in a child. Seeing only a child in a child is very dangerous. If you see only a child in a child it is you who are becoming a child. We must fight ignorance about the foundational importance of early childhood in human development -- in character formation and mental development.We fail to recognize that the child is everything. The church has to lead in this. Pastor Nam Soo Kim and Luis sit reflecting on all that they are seeing and hearing in amazement and awe. We begin to see a giant arising in French speaking Africa through the instruction and the growing number of speakers indicating that this is so. Scene Three: An illustration about a child who became a giant in faith Over lunch on the final day of the conference Etienne Pousga Zongo told our thirteen year old granddaughter, Sophia Himalaya, his story which illustrates how a little lost boy of six worshipping a tree could become a giant serving 1056 ministers of the gospel and 1100 churches in Burkina Faso. He explained the markings on his face applied with a knife when he was four which identify the clan from among the Mossi People he is from. Sophia had researched on the internet and prepared a report of the Mossi People so it was the goodness of God that we were sitting with someone from that people for lunch on the final day of the conference. As Etienne told his story of how he came to faith and grew in his understanding of the ways of God it became clear that from a little child without God and without hope he had become a towering strength of faith and inspiration. He shared with Sophia counsel as a 4/14er first to recognize that God is real. He told Sophia out of the lessons of his life that three most important things for a 4/14ers are 1. To know that God is real, 2. Each day read at least one word of God&#39;s Word. 3. Speak to God every day. Scene Four: Implications for implementation Jonas Sawadogo, facilitator for the 4/14 initiative in French speaking Africa exhorted all the participants. Be ambassadors in your country of the 4/14 Window Movement. We believe you have grasped this vision. Let the 4/14 Movement be your main burden. We agree to share the work. We agree to share the cost. From this moment you are a member of the national 4/14 Committee in your country. Go and meet with brothers and sisters and share the burden with them. This is the strategy. Hand-picking one person at a time and talk to them of the things you have seen and heard here. Set up a team for your nation to carry forward the 4/14 Initiative in the nation. Plan a national 4/14 summit in your country before the end of this year. Be diligent and persevere, persevere, persevere and pray and pray and pray. A mother stood up and moved us all as she appealed to mothers to nurture in the first years of a child&#39;s life as only a mother can. She said about the 4/14 Movement &quot;this is our movement.&quot; We were exhorted by another woman who received a word from the Lord directly form Matthew 10 and read it word for word to go forth two by two in the nations of French speaking Africa. Stéphane Lauzet : World Evangelical Alliance (WEA) Regional representative to the francophone world wrote: &quot;It is as a visitor and observer that I speak and particularly as a person newly entrusted by the WEA with a mission to serve Evangelicals in the French-speaking world. It is wonderful to see such a gathering and on such a scale organized in Africa by Africans. I appreciate the brotherly warmth and spirit of service of the organizations associated with the event. It was a privilege to hear pertinent teaching delivered in many interesting and varied styles. Without a doubt, it is important that the support such a project and encourage the churches of WEA to dedicate themselves to pursuing this vision.&quot; Michel Ouedraogo, President of the largest denomination in Burkina Faso, exhorted us to &quot;Go back and make disciples of the children.&quot; Representing the 4/14 Initiative in South Asia, Jesudason made recommendations based on what they are doing in South Asia including the following: Seminars for parents on &quot;Shepherding the hearts of children,&quot; Parents are desperate. How to get their kids out of PORN and into discerning God&#39;s will for their lives. Advocacy appeal on behalf of the children. Holistic Child Development training. Curriculum of courses are now available and readily distributable for designed for certificate, MA. Pastor Nam Soo Kim confirmed at a final lunch with the 4/14 Steering Committee that intercessors from Promise Church in New York, which hosted the first two global summits, have been assigned to pray for the different countries of the world. He committed to send God&#39;s servants and intercessors to each of the twenty six French speaking countries in Africa before the end of March of 2014. Reed Olson exhorted the participants to reach every 4/14er in Burkina Faso and French speaking Africa using the Story of Jesus. In 2010, Olson reported, &quot;following the 4/14 conference in New York, I captured the Lord&#39;s vision to present the Gospel to every one of the world&#39;s 1.2 billion unreached children and youth (ages 4-14) through a unique kind of resource, one that would grab and hold their undivided attention in an informative yet fun and captivating way.&quot; David C. Cook responded by creating The Story of Jesus Christ (SOJ), a 16-page booklet illustrated by DC and Marvel Comics artist, Sergio Cariello, from Brazil. The response has been amazing, whether in urban Cambodian districts or Pakistani Sunday School classes or in remote Peruvian Amazon villages. &quot;The Lord inspired and anointed it,&quot; Olson explained, &quot;and with the support of national church networks and ministries in 42 nations, we&#39;ve helped to equip believers with enough copies in 11 languages to share with 17.5 million 4/14ers in the past 9 months alone.&quot; Dialogue is occurring, in addition, with interested parties in another 43 countries (including South Sudan, Malawi, Vietnam, Uzbekistan and Switzerland). The morning Olson spoke, a request was received for 250,000 Arabic copies for war-torn Syria, followed by another 10 million Hindi copies for India. In late March, thousands of booklets will be launched by helium balloons into the skies of South Korea, floated over the heavily guarded Demilitarized Zone and dropped into strategic locations inside North Korea (ranked #1 by Open Doors among countries that persecute the church most severely). &quot;There is no place on earth God&#39;s Good News cannot go,&quot; Olson shared, &quot;as long as the Lord opens the door and the church is willing to co-labor with Him to share it, to work with other members of the Body of Christ, to be daring and courageous and invest its time, talent and treasure to complete the unfinished task at hand with all of its might.&quot; &quot;If,&quot; Olson concluded, &quot;the Lord is stirring you to equip your armies with this spiritual weapon in your nations, David C. Cook would be honored to help support your efforts in winning all of your unreached 4/14ers to Jesus, as the Lord leads.&quot; Conclusion: &quot;It is time we stop seeing only poor children in our children. It is time to see a Queen in our orphan girls.&quot; (Shiferaw Michael). Harry Bryans, 4/14 Window facilitator for Western Europe said: &quot;What some refer to as the &quot;sleeping giant&quot; of Africa is waking up to a new awareness of God&#39;s heart for the children and the urgent need to make them a vital and permanent focus of the Church&#39;s prayers and action. Over 2/3 of the French speaking countries are in Africa and following this gathering the francophone church will never be the same again!&quot;",

Según él, el propósito de la conferencia fue concientizar a los siervos de Dios en relación a los niños de 4 a14 años de edad que son vulnerables, pero abiertos a la Palabra de Dios. Jean-Baptiste de traje con su señora y un grupo de participantes El facilitador del movimiento en los países africanos de habla francés, Jonás Sawadogo, dijo que la iniciativa global de la ventana 4/14 que comenzó en septiembre de 2009 en Nueva York, nos llama a un cambio de postura en relación a los niños. El Dr. Jean-Baptiste Rouamba por veinticuatro años desempeñó un ministerio pastoral en una iglesia de tres mil miembros llamada Centrale des Assemblées Eglise de Dieu y reflexionó sobre la conferencia y la forma en que representa un cambio fundamental en la dirección de la Iglesia de Burkina Faso y Sub –región. Seguidamente él cuenta la historia de cómo esto sucedió. En 2010, tuve el privilegio con otros tres de Burkina Faso de asistir a la Segunda Conferencia Mundial sobre la Ventana 4/14 celebrada en la Iglesia Promise Church en Nueva York. Para mi sorpresa, un pequeño número de países de habla francesa asistieron al evento. Durante la conferencia, la semilla fue plantada en mi corazón para iniciar el movimiento y para compartir la visión con la dirección ejecutiva de mi denominación. Con Jonás Sawadogo y otras dos personas que asistieron a la conferencia en Nueva York, empecé a reunir con ellos en mi oficina para orar acerca de la visión y buscar el rostro de Dios. Al principio pensé que sería bueno planificar una conferencia nacional para compartir la visión con los líderes de la iglesia, los maestros de escuela dominical y los trabajadores del ministerio de los niños. Durante la oración, el Señor puso en nuestros corazones pensar en algo grande. Decidimos que sería bueno incluir a los países vecinos que hablan el francés como su idioma oficial. El Señor nos animó a ser lo suficientemente audaz para ejecutar un plan para toda África de habla francesa, a pesar de que algunos de nosotros pensamos que sería imposible. Dios nos mostró que necesitábamos tomar un paso de fe y que El hará que la visión se torna en realidad. En primera instancia, tuvimos la intención de preparar para 200 participantes. Luego aumentó nuestra fe y pensamos en preparar para 300 participantes. Cuando hicimos la cuenta durante los talleres contamos 725 personas ocupándose en la iniciativa 4/14 en los grupos de trabajo. Sofía, ñieta de 13 años de Doris y Luis Bush sentada a la izquierda La ceremonia de inauguración celebrada en el Templo Emmanuel en Ouagadougou es un testimonio de la gracia de Dios. Todos los líderes evangélicos de Burkina Faso llegaron para la apertura. Como prueba de su apoyo, el Consejo de la AEA (Asociación de Evangélicos de África), también apoyaron con su presencia. La reunión en Ouagadougou es un momento histórico marcando un cambio contundente para el continente. La conferencia fue más allá de nuestras expectativas. Dios nos sorprendió con su abundante gracia. No esperábamos tan rotunda respuesta. El número de participantes se duplicó con delegados procediendo de Benín, Togo, Costa de Marfil, Guinea, Chad, Malí, República Democrática del Congo, República Centroafricana, la isla de Mauricio, Madagascar, Senegal, Níger y Burkina Faso.A Dios sea toda la gloria. Harry Bryans, de Bélgica, Facilitador del Movimientode la Ventana 4/14 por la Europa occidental, ve esto como un punto de partida no sólo para África de habla francesa, sino también para el mundo de habla francesa. &quot;Esta primera Conferencia 14.4 Ventana para el África francófona marca un cambio decisivo en la historia de la iglesia, no sólo en este continente de África, sino también en el mundo de habla francesa!&quot; Harry Bryans a la izquierda con Jonás Sawadogo Lo que algunos llaman el “gigante dormido,” o sea África francófona se está despertando a una nueva conciencia del corazón de Dios para los niños y la urgente necesidad de hacer que el foco vital y permanente de las oraciones de la Iglesia y la acción. Más de la mitad de los 26 países de habla francesa en África francófona participaron. Después de este encuentro histórico la iglesia nunca volverá a ser la misma otra vez! Se sintió un mover fresco de la visión y una gran dedicación. Una antorcha fue encendida que se llevará a los numerosos países representados y más allá. Como el facilitador de Europa occidental, he sentido muy inspirado y alentado. El Señor está abriendo nuevas puertas de relación y asociación con Europa de habla francesa, que también multiplica su bendición a las iglesias y los niños allí.",

    "content": "Serving | Catalyzing | Facilitating 4/14 Window Movement in Africa March 10, 2012 4/14 Window Regional Conference for Francophone AfricaPart I: A Crucial Turning Point of the Church of Burkina Faso and of French Speaking Africa and Beyond The Francophone countries’ regional conference on the 4/14 window’s global initiative, took place in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso from March 6 to 9, 2012 with the participation of more than one half of the twenty six countries of French speaking Africa focused on the theme: “Better partnering with children and young people to transform our nations.” For Dr. Jean-Baptiste Rouamba, the national coordinator of the vision, this conference is a crucial turning point of the Church of Burkina Faso and of the Sub-Region. According to him, the objective of the conference was to awaken people’s conscience in relation to children of 4 to 14 age bracket who are vulnerable but open to the Word of God. The facilitator of the movement in the Francophone countries, Jonas Robert Sawadogo, pointed out that 4/14 Window’s global initiative launched in September 2009 in New York, calls out to a change of vision towards children. Dr. Jean-Baptiste Rouamba has served twenty four years of the three thousand member Eglise centrale des assemblées de Dieu reflected on the conference and why it represents a crucial turning point of the Church of Burkina Faso and of the Sub-Region in the following report and tells the story of how it came to pass. In 2010, I had the privilege along three others from Burkina Faso to attend the Second Global Summit held Promise Church in New York. To my surprise, a small number of French speaking countries attended the Summit. During this Summit, the seed was sown in my heart to start the movement and to share the vision with the Executive Leadership of my denomination. With Jonas Sawadogo and two others who attended the New York Summit, we began meeting in my office to pray about the vision and to seek God’s face. We first thought it would be good to plan for a national conference to share the vision with church leaders, Sunday school teachers and children ministry workers. During our time of prayer, the Lord put on our hearts to think big. We then decided it would be good to include the surrounding countries that have French as their official language. The Lord encouraged us to be bold enough to plan for all francophone Africa. Even though some of us did not think it would be possible, God showed us that we need to step out in faith for the conference. We first planned for 200 participants and then for 300. The opening ceremony held at Emmanuel Temple in Ouagadougou is a testimony of the grace of God on the movement. All the Evangelical leaders came for the opening ceremony. As a proof of their support, the Board of AEA (Alliance of Evangelicals of Africa) was also present at the opening ceremony. The Francophone gathering in Ouagadougou is a historic moment and a turning point for the continent. The conference went beyond our expectation. God has surprised us with His abundant grace. We did not expect such a response from the leaders and children’s ministry workers. The number of participants has more than doubled and delegates came from Benin, Togo, Ivory Coast, Guinea Conakry, Chad, Mali, Democratic Republic of Congo, Central African Republic, Mauritius, Madagascar, Senegal, Niger, and Burkina Faso. To God be the glory. Dr. Luis Bush, his wife Doris and granddaughter, Sophia, Rev Nam Soo Kim and a team from the Promise Church came to support the launching of the Francophone 4/14 window. Pictured to the left are Sophia, Doris and the other participants. As a chairman of the conference, I expect all participants to take back to their countries the vision for the 4/14 generation. The conference is a total success. As the potential to reach this generation is in our hands, I exhort all the participants to keep the light shining in their respective countries. I recommend that the participants organize national or regional conferences to share and spread the vision. This is a God-given opportunity for us to reach the 4/14 generation. I recommend that all participants be leaders of the movement in their countries, churches, communities and organizations. I also recommend that all church leaders or church organizations leaders get deeply involved in making children and youth reaching their top priority. I also recommend that decision we have made together be a solid foundation so that we can reach the children and youth. Jean-Baptist in the suit with his wife and some of the participants The conference has allowed the participants to get involved in spreading the movement. As the chairman of the conference, I exhort all the participants to be ambassadors of the 4/14 Window Movement in their countries, communities, churches and society. The goal of organizing such a conference has been reached. We have launched the movement and the participants have to spread it. The movement is of God and our responsibility is to keep it alive. Throughout the conference, the Spirit of the Lord mightily moved and a lady received a revelation from God that the participants should not take lightly the movement. There was a time of prayer for the ministry among the children. Praise God for His glorious presence. Harry Bryans, 4/14 Window Movement Facilitator for Western Europe, views this as a turning point not only for French-speaking Africa but also the French speaking world. Harry Bryans from Belgium on left with the conference facilitator Jonas Sawadogo This first 4/14 Window Conference for Francophone Africa marks a decisive turning point in the history of the church, not just in this continent but also in the French speaking world! What some refer to as the &quot;sleeping giant&quot; of Africa is waking up to a new awareness of God’s heart for the children and the urgent need to make them a vital and permanent focus of the Church’s prayers and action. Over 2/3 of the French speaking countries are in Africa and following this gathering the francophone church will never be the same again! Fresh fires of vision and dedication have been lit here and the torches will be carried back to the many countries represented and beyond. As Western European Facilitator, I have been greatly inspired and encouraged. The Lord is opening new doors of relationship and partnership with francophone Europe that will also multiply His blessing to the churches and the children there.",

    "content": "Serving | Catalyzing | Facilitating China Press Release - Message from Church in 21st Century China Winter 2011 Let China Know the World and the World Know China Update&quot;A Message from the Church in Twenty-First Century China&quot; Luis Bush It&#39;s been almost 10 years since I was in Beijing to meet with a group of top-level Christian leaders of networks of churches in China as part of the World Inquiry to &quot;Let China Know the World and the World Know China&quot;. Recently, I returned to Beijing to get an update to the 2002 meeting. It was graciously organized and hosted by one of the leading third wave churches in the city. In the course of the original meetings the participants expressed their desire to send a message to Christians outside of China. This press release, read and carefully reviewed and endorsed for publication, represents a core part of that message as it came through in the papers, formal and informal discussion and the Inquiry process. It is outlined in three sections. Our vision and dreams for the Church in China Our commitments emerging from the consultation &quot;Let China know the world and the world to know China&quot; New realities in China Section I. Our vision and dreams for the Church in China. As Christians, we wish to be a blessing to the country of China of which we are citizens. We envision an evangelized China and move from the coastlands in the east to the relatively less evangelized central and western parts of our country. We dream of the unity of the whole Church in China. We are being called by God to engage in cross-cultural vision not only within our own nation but beyond. We are calling forth a mission force to take the gospel back along the &quot;Old Silk Road&quot; from where it first came to us in 635 A.D. We call this the Back-to-Jerusalem Movement as our intention is to take the gospel back to Jerusalem itself where the Commission to be witnesses was first given by the Lord Jesus to his disciples (Acts 1:8). This was 1930’s home-grown movement which began with the idea of carrying the gospel on foot all the way back to Jerusalem retracing the steps of the Old Silk Road. We desire for the Church outside of China to join us in the Back-to-Jerusalem vision and invite them to help come and prepare us for the cross-cultural mission. We desire to bless our country of China by engaging in constructive, compassionate holistic mission to help build our society in the twenty-first century. Section II. Our joint commitment made at &quot;Let China know the world and the world to know China.&quot; We are committed to bring glory to God in all we do and by faith, joyfully receive and willingly embrace the gift given to by our master when he prayed to our heavenly father saying: &quot;I have given them the glory that you gave me, that they may be one as we are one&quot; (John 17:22). We dream of the unity of the whole Church in China and appeal to denominational church leaders and representatives inside and outside of China to join us our commitment for unity and the intercessory prayer of Jesus: &quot;I in them and you in me. May they be brought to complete unity to let the world know that you sent me and have loved them even as you have loved me&quot; (John 17:23). Start cross-cultural mission training in our networks and churches. We commit to the raising up younger leaders and mentoring them in the ways and mission of our Lord by identifying a young man and a young woman in each city who is between twenty-five and forty-five years old, seeking to build a community of love and truth among them and send fifty to represent the emerging leaders of China. We commit to serve our country of China as upright citizens desiring God&#39;s blessing on our land. We commit to a new way of thinking when it comes to children and youth ministry. We will strive to be more intentional about the spiritual development of our next generation. Section III. New realities in China In the past 10 years the urban churches have been explosively growing, the Gospel work has been expanded throughout the country. A new model for the urban church has been developed. But there has not been the expected reformation within the Three-Self Church System. The Chinese Church continues to need assistance from the Global Church not in the traditional missions paradigm but as an equal partner to help the Chinese church more holistically in affecting all parts of the society. We, participants in this consultation, sensed in the Spirit that this is not only a tipping point in the life of China as a nation but that this is also a tipping point in the life of the Church in China. We sense that God is bringing forth a new stream of the Church in China and the influence of the Church is growing increasingly on the Chinese society.",

    "content": "Sirviendo | Catalizando | Facilitando Transforma Chile en Contexto de la Visión de la Ventana 4/14 en Debate en Chile por la Vida del Niño no Nacido 22 de Noviembre de 2011 Anoche, un debate sobre Aborto Terapéutico congregó el médico, Presidente del Senado de Chile y otros senadores conducido por Agustín Zamora, Facilitador del movimiento Transforma Chile en que fue un privilegio participar con una reflexión al final del debate. Para Doris y para mi han sido días marcantes en nuestra vida aquí en Chile al ver las primicias de un movimiento de transformación. Suplicamos sus oraciones por Agustín, su esposa Carolina y los facilitadores y 150 participantes emergentes de las siete esferas de influencia cultural con quien reunimos el día 21 de noviembre juntamente con Ricardo Luna, Facilitador del Movimiento de la Ventana 4/14, Presidente de CONELA y Director de OneHope para América Latina y Soledad Rosas, Facilitadora del Movimiento de la Ventana 4/14 en Chile. Palabras Introductorias del Reporte del Debate sobre Aborto Terapéutico por Agustín Zamora, Facilitador Transforma Chile Rapidamente Latinoamerica está siendo afectada por leyes que han sido promulgadas en gran parte de Europa y USA, tales como matrimonio homosexual y aborto terapéutico. Por lo mismo, la iglesia de Jesucristo debe prepararse estratégicamente, evitando con ello situaciones como las ocurridas en Argentina, con relación al matrimonio homosexual. Chile no ha estado exento en esta materia y ya se encuentra en discusión en el Parlamento, el llamado “AVP”, Acuerdo de Vida en Pareja, una antesala al “matrimonio homosexual” y varios proyectos de ley presentados por Senadores a favor del aborto terapéutico, que probablemente estén en tabla para discusión a fines de Diciembre. Este escenario, nos hizo reaccionar como Transforma Chile, bajo el contexto de la visión 4/14, sobre la necesidad de organizar un debate de los que están a favor y en contra del aborto terapéutico, sus principales implicancias y reflexiones se relatan en la siguiente nota periodística realizada por un profesional católico, difundida a través de distintos medios. En el ex Congreso NacionalDebate sobre Aborto Terapéutico congregó a parlamentarios y representantes de diversos sectores Foro será posteriormente transmitido por programa Conciencia de Valores de UCV Televisión. Un interesante debate sobre Aborto Terapéutico fue el que se llevó cabo en la remodelada sala de sesiones de la Cámara de Diputados del ex Congreso Nacional en Santiago, y en el cual participaron parlamentarios y representantes de diversos sectores. En la ocasión, cada panelista tuvo la oportunidad de dar a conocer su visión respecto a los diversos temas relativos al aborto terapéutico, en los cuales se pudo observar las marcadas diferencias de quienes se muestran partidarios o contrarios a esta temática, lo cual hace pensar en lo difícil que será el debate respecto a esta materia en el corto y mediano plazo. El evento, producido por el programa Conciencia de Valores, contó con la participación del médico, Presidente del Senado, y miembro de la Comisión de Salud, Guido Girardi; el Senador UDI, Alejandro García-Huidobro; el Senador del Partido Socialista y presidente de la Comisión de Salud, Fulvio Rossi; el presidente del Partido Progresista y ex candidato presidencial, Marco Enríquez-Ominami; el abogado y representante de organizaciones Pro Vida, Jorge Reyes; y el Capellán de La Moneda, Alfred Cooper. Agustín Zamora, conductor de Conciencia de Valores y presidente de la fundación Mundo Diferente y del movimiento Transforma Chile, destacó la importancia de esta actividad para que las personas conozcan de primera fuente el pensamiento de quienes lo representan en el poder legislativo, considerando que está en juego la defensa de uno de los principios fundamentales de nuestra sociedad, como es el derecho a la vida. Zamora, agregó que &quot;la decisión de transmitir el programa nace producto del gran interés mostrado por los diversos actores sociales del país en torno al aborto terapéutico, y en ese sentido creemos que el análisis producido en esta actividad puede contribuir a que la gente saque sus propias conclusiones sobre este tema&quot;. Punto destacado además, fue la intervención de Luis Bush, líder del movimiento de Transformación Mundial 4/14, quien se refirió a las tres causas en las cuales se pretende usar el aborto terapéutico. La primera, cuando está en riesgo la vida de la madre, en lo cual se puede estar de acuerdo, solo que se pretende usar esta causal cuando en realidad es un aborto disfrazado. La segunda, cuando se dice que la mujer tiene sus derechos, sobre todo en materia de una concepción por una violación. &quot;La pregunta aquí es ¿quién protege los derechos de un no nacido totalmente inocente?, siendo una salida la entrega en adopción y no el aborto&quot;, indicó Bush. Finalmente, el representante del movimiento de Transformación Mundial 4/14, señaló que el tercer argumento utilizado por quienes defienden el aborto dice relación con que en las primeras semanas el embrión sería una célula y no vida una humana, siendo eso totalmente contradictorio a lo que Dios menciona en su Palabra, concluyó Luis Bush. El debate podrá ser visto el próximo domingo 27 de noviembre a las 17:30 horas, a través de UCV televisión, y será también retransmitido por las señales de ART TV y LIV TV.",

    "content": "Serving | Catalyzing | Facilitating Engaging in the Transform Chile Debate on the Right to Life for the Unborn in the Context of the 4/14 Window Vision November 22, 2011 Last night a debate on Therapeutic Abortion brought together the President of the Senate of Chile, a medical doctor and other senators orchestrated by Agustin Zamora, Transform Chile Facilitator. It was a privilege to participate in the debate. Doris and I have been deeply moved to see the beginnings of a movement of transformation and the 4/14 Movement here in Chile. We request your prayers for Agustin Zamora, his wife Carolina and emerging facilitators and 150 participants of the seven spheres of cultural influence with whom we met with on November 21 along with Ricardo Luna, Facilitator for Latin America of the 4 / 14 Movement, President of CONELA and OneHope Director for Latin America. Opening Remarks Report on Therapeutic Abortion Debate by Agustin Zamora, Chile Transform Facilitator Quickly Latin America is being affected by laws that have been enacted in most of Europe and the USA such as gay marriage and therapeutic abortion. For this reason, the Church of Jesus Christ must prepare strategically, thereby avoiding situations such as occurred in Argentina, in relation to gay marriage. This matter is already under discussion in the Parliament here in Chile. Senators in favor of therapeutic abortion made their points in this debate which are likely to the arguments tabled for discussion in Congress for debate at the end of December. In this national scenario we have responded to this challenge in our capacity as Transform Chile, under the context of the 4 / 14 Vision, by convening this debate with the top government leaders within the congress where the full debate among the politicians will soon be held. The following news story on last night’s debate was written by a Catholic journalist and disseminated through various media in Chile. In the former National Congress Chamber in Santiago,Therapeutic Abortion Debate brought together parliamentarians and representatives of various sectors Forum program will later be broadcast on Values Consciousness UCV Television. An interesting debate on Therapeutic Abortion was the one that took place in the refurbished meeting room of the Chamber of Deputies of the former National Congress in Santiago, which was attended by parliamentarians and representatives of various sectors. On this occasion, each panelist had the opportunity to make known his views on the various issues related to therapeutic abortion, in which it was observed that there were marked differences in the remarks between those who are in favor and those who are against this issue, which suggests how difficult it will be a debate regarding this matter in the short and long term. Guido Girardi, the President of the Senate, a physician, and member of the Committee on Health, senator of the Union Democratic party, Alejandro Garcia-Huidobro, the Socialist Party Senator and president of Health Commission, Fulvio Rossi, the president of the Progressive Party and former presidential candidate, Marco Enríquez-Ominami, lawyer and representative of Pro-Life organizations, Jorge Reyes, and the chaplain of the President of the Country (La Moneda), Alfred Cooper. Agustin Zamora, leader of Transform Chile, and President of the Foundation Mundo Diferente (a different world) and Transform Chile, stressed the importance of this activity so that people in Chile may know firsthand the thoughts of those who represent them in the legislature, considering it is a play of the defense of one of the fundamental principles of our society, such as is the right to life. Zamora added that &quot;the decision to transmit the program on television was born out of the great interest shown by various social lead actors in the country on therapeutic abortion, and in that sense we believe that the analysis produced in this activity can help people draw their own conclusions on this issue.&quot; A further highlight was the participation of Luis Bush, facilitator of Transform World Connections and catalyst of the 4 /14 Movement, who referred to three main arguments presented in the debate in favor of therapeutic abortion. First, therapeutic abortion when life is at risk for the mother though this is often a disguised abortion. Second, when we say that women have their rights, especially in terms of a conception by rape. &quot;The question here is who protects the rights of a totally innocent unborn? Consider adoption, not abortion,&quot; Bush said. &nbsp; Finally, the representative of Global Transformation Movement 4 / 14, noted that the third argument used by those who support abortion in the debate is related to the fact that in the first weeks the living cells are not yet a human being yet this is so totally contradictory to what God has made clear in His Word, Luis Bush concluded. The debate may be seen on Sunday November 27 at 17:30 through UCV TV, and will also be broadcast on ART TV signals and TV LIV.",

Un pastor observo que &quot;los corazones de muchos Chinos están vacíos. En los últimos 30 años, el nivel moral se ha empeorado.&quot; Los de la Ventana 4/14 están desesperados. Una encuesta tomada hace cuatro meses de unos 4500 jóvenes entre los 13 a 18 años de 12 ciudades indica que 41% de ellos habían considerado suicidarse en los últimos tres meses y 34% había intentado hacerlo. Un punto destacado del viaje fue descubrir la historia a través de una entrevista larga con uno de esos jóvenes quien surgió como líder de la iglesia en China, y quien hoy es pastor de una de las iglesias más grandes en Beijing.

    "content": "Serving | Catalyzing | Facilitating 4/14 Window Movement in China November 16, 2011 The purpose of the trip to China was to encourage the raising up of a new generation from the 4/14 Window to transform China and beyond. A pastor observed that &quot;many Chinese people&#39;s hearts are empty. In the past 30 years, the moral standard has been getting worse.&quot; The 4/14ers are desperate. A survey taken four months ago of 4500 thirteen to eighteen year olds from 12 cities indicated that 41% of those who took the survey had thought of committing suicide in the previous three months and 34% had tried to do so. A highlight of the trip was discovering the story though a long interview of one who had been among the desperate youth and who has emerged as a young leader of the church in China, now pastoring at one of the largest churches in Beijing. You can read the entire story here.1 Beijing: Home Groups of Historic Three-Self Church Experience Vitality of Faith In early 2011, the Chongwenmen Church (which was established in 1870)divided into cell groups, according to regions where people live in Beijing. The map of Beijing to which Pastor Lee and I are pointing identifies the locations of the cell groups, listing the names of group leaders and the location addresses. Now there are 60 groups, according to Pastor Lee. He teaches the leaders every Wednesday and bases the lesson on the Sunday morning sermon. The home groups meet mainly for discussion. Read more about this amazing church that grew from 3,000 to 6,000 members in the last four years here.1 A Beijing 4/14 Window one-day Forum brought together 80 Christian leaders from the rapidly growing Third Wave Church movement, which is planting churches in the mega-cities of China through the initiative of a nationally-respected Christian leader. The draft of a China 4/14 Strategic Plan – prepared after a two-year process of research, review and assessment – was signed by the participants. The major challenges call for discerning the times in which... Family Systems are in an era of high transition Young people are seeking role models relevant to their concerns Children and Youth need social and life skills development in addition to quality education Media often promotes values contrary to positive attitudes and behavior in youth Traditional institutions struggle to be relevant to the needs of youth You can read and download the entire 4/14 China Strategic Plan here.2 ShanghaiBreakfast with Christian business people from Korea drew attention to how they can engage as parents and business people in the awesome task of raising up a new generation. The Shanghai 4/14 Window Conference engaged 80 community influencers. 4/14 East Asia facilitator John Hur spoke about the call and commission. 4/14 Window South China ConferenceThirty pastors and church leaders from the Three-Self Church joined 100 House Church leaders and several others from the host city. The facilitator wrote, “It is a new breakthrough to see both house and official leaders coming together for a similar event. It is a new day as most of the major families are represented. It is an amazing meeting.” Thanks for joining us and many others in raising up a new generation from the 4/14 Window to transform the world! Luis and Doris PRAYER POINT: PLEASE PRAY For the upcoming journey of Doris and Luis November 15 to 30 to Uruguay, Chile, and Argentina to raise up a new generation from the 4/14 Window to transform the world.

    "title": "4/14 Window Strategy Handbook",
    "content": "4/14 Window Strategy Handbook The 4/14 Window refers to the demographic group ages 4 to 14, which is the most open and receptive group to spiritual and developmental input. God is calling us to a new missional focus: the 4/14 Window, the golden age of opportunity to transform the world. God is also calling us to radically change the way we view children and to respond to their strategic importance and rightful place in His kingdom. This often-ignored and suffering people group can be transformed into a precious window of opportunity. The Bible commands every Christian to “speak up for those who cannot speak for themselves, for the rights of all who are destitute” (Proverbs 31:8, niv). The Shema (Deuteronomy 6:4-7; 11:19) admonishes us to communicate God’s grace to our children. Psalm 78:4 (niv) declares, &quot;We will tell the next generation the praiseworthy deeds of the LORD, his power, and the wonders he has done.&quot; Jesus affirms this in Luke 18:16 (niv): &quot;Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of God belongs to such as these.&quot; In God’s hands, children can become agents of transformational mission under the headship of Jesus Christ. The needs, nature and challenges of raising up a new generation out of the 4/14 Window are presented in The 4/14 Window by Luis Bush (Compassion: 2009). Raising Up a New Generation from the 4/14 Window to Transform the World (a.k.a. 4/14 Window Global Initiative) requires a bold process of collaboration and mobilization that seeks to obey God’s call to this new missional focus.

    "title": "Raising Up a New Generation from the 4/14 Window to Transform the World",
    "content": "Raising Up a New Generation from the 4/14 Window to Transform the World At the end of the last century I wrote a pamphlet entitled The 10/40 Window: Getting to the Core of the Core.2 In the first years of this new century, I am urging a new missional focus: The 4/14 Window. Although in a different sense, it too can be called “the core of the core.” The 10/40 Window referenced a geographic frame; the 4/14 Window describes a demographic frame—a life season comprising the ten years between the ages of 4 and 14. This booklet is an urgent appeal to consider the strategic importance and potential of the 1.2 billion children and youth in the 4/14 Window. It is a plea to open your heart and mind to the idea of reaching and raising up a new generation from within that vast group—a generation that can experience personal transformation and can be mobilized as agents for transformation throughout the world. Our vision and hope is to maximize their transformational impact while they are young, and to mobilize them for continuing impact for the rest of their lives. I invite you to join with many others who are making a commitment to fulfill this vision and realize this hope. To maximize the transformational impact of children and youth in the 4/14 Window we must address the spiritual, mental, physical, relational, economic, and social issues they face. We must also confront their “ministerial poverty”—the scarcity of opportunities for them to exercise their gifts and achieve their potential in ways that honor God and advance His Kingdom. It is crucial that mission efforts be re-prioritized and re-directed toward the 4/14 age group world- wide. This requires that we become acutely aware of what is taking place in their lives. We must also endeavor to understand their nature and the essential means to nurture them. Only with this kind of in- formed awareness will we be able to reach them, shape them, and raise them up to transform the world. This booklet presents an overview of the needs, nature and potential of children and youth in the 4/14 Window. It also addresses the very real opposition and obstacles to raising them up as a transformational generation. We must not be defeated by the opposition or deterred by the obstacles; and as we engage in strategic global thinking and answer God’s call to catalytic action, we must do so within a biblical framework.

    "title": "You Need to Know About My Friend",
    "content": "4/14 Window Strategy Handbook I was introduced to Luis Bush several years ago by our mutual friend, Dr. Alan Johnson. Alan is a former teacher of mine at Wheaton College and has become a dear friend over the years. Alan also serves on the advisory board of ACT 3 and is a champion for me and the work that I do. Alan also has the wonderful habit of introducing his friends to other friends that he has made over the years. He is one of the most faithful retired professors I know, continuing to give himself to the kingdom actively each day. Thus I came to have a memorable lunch at the Wheaton College Commons with Luis Bush about five years ago. Since then I have shared several more private meetings with Alan and Luis. For some reason these two brothers continue to invite me into their conversation and fellowship. a fellowship that engages my mind and soul very profoundly. I want you to know about Luis Bush and also pray for him as I do. Luis Bush was born in Argentina, but was raised in Brazil. In 1970 he graduated from the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill, N.C., in economics. He then worked in Business Consulting for a Big Eight accounting firm in Chicago before deciding in 1973 to devote his life to Christian ministry. After his graduation from theological seminary in 1978, Luis, with his wife Doris and their family, relocated to San Salvador to serve at the Iglesia Nazaret as senior pastor. Bush also led a movement of missions called COMIBAM (from Latin America) during its initial phase and later served as CEO of Partners International from 1986 to 1992, an organization that seeks to grow communities of Christian witnesses in largely non-Christian areas by partnering with indigenous Christian ministries. He served as the international director of the AD2000 &amp; Beyond Movement from 1989-2001. If you know missions at all you can readily grasp that this is an amazing biography. Men like John R. Mott and Lesslie Newbigin are known to many as my &quot;deceased&quot; missional heros. Luis Bush has become my &quot;living&quot; missional hero. You can readily see why I wanted to get to know him given my passion for world missions. Luis is actually the person who coined the now well-known term 10/40 Window. This idea helped millions of Christians to focus on the region of the world with greatest human suffering combined with least exposure to Christianity. Transform World was the name given to the first global event in Indonesia in 2005 when Luis was asked to serve as international facilitator for other related events processes. Transform World Connections (TWC) exists to build a community of servant-catalysts engaged in God’s mission of transformation that results in the healing and blessing of the nations. Our of this background the blog I wrote yesterday, about the 4/14 Window developed. Luis Bush completed a PhD in Intercultural Studies from Fuller School of World Mission in 2003. The study of catalytic antecedents of today’s mission led to a World Inquiry conducted from 2002 to 2004 involving participants from more than 700 cities. It became clear that a compelling new paradigm of “mission as transformation” has emerged at the beginning of the 21st Century. It is out of this paradigm that the 4/14 Window developed. Question: Can we reach and transform young people from inside the 4/14 Window and through such a movement plant vital new churches? Answer: This is happening all over the world, even in the U.S. I know this is true because my own son, Matthew, served middle school teenagers in public schools for eight years and out of this effort planted New Hope Community in Streamwood, Illinois. This church is thriving, reaching many new adult Christ followers and discipling them faithfully. New Hope grew directly out of a 4/14 Window paradigm without even knowing the term at the time. I am sold that this is a strategy that is both biblical and anointed by God for the present time.

    "content": "Transform World Indonesia 2005 Handbook Overview Through the World Inquiry, a consultative process involving Christian leaders from around the world, two clear and consistent messages have emerged as we begin the 21st Century: First, a renewed call for the whole Church to take the whole Gospel to the whole world. And second, a new paradigm of Mission as Transformation to describe what God is doing in our world in building His Kingdom. In the midst of a fallen, broken world needing transformation: Individuals are being called to be conformed to the image of Christ and transformed by His indwelling Spirit. Churches are being challenged to be renewed and reformed to align with God’s greater purposes and be transformed in the process. Cities and nations are being impacted and transformed as God fulfills His purposes for the nations in our time. The Vision of “Mission as Transformation” is to see all nations redeemed, restored, and transformed, as cultures increasingly reflect the value system of the Kingdom of God — now and in the future — that the power, the presence and the peace of God be experienced by all.

    "title": "Report of Transform World Global Interest Group Meeting",
    "content": "Report of Transform World Global Interest Group Meeting London, England 7 to 9, September 2004 I. Introductory Remarks We looked forward to considering the global transformational initiatives taking place in Africa, Asia, Latin America, Europe, North America and around the world. We came to hear from the Lord together. We linked continents around the transformation movement for a time of sharing, and seeking God for a united response of the body to the head of the Church, the Lord Jesus. We celebrated the vision and reality of the River of Life flowing from God’s throne for the healing of all nations (Rev. 22), broadening and deepening even as we go! II. What Transpired This gathering was completely an “open agenda” meeting. Beyond the dates and place set, there was no pre-set content agenda, nor were there certain predetermined outcome expectations, beyond that which came forth from the participant’s discussions through prayer and inputs/suggestions for the going-forward of this movement of the Lord that is clearly already underway.” Beyond our extended times of waiting on the Lord and seasons of worship, an open time of “individual expectations” was held and articulated as shown below. This was followed by an overview of what has developed thus far. Each participant provided extensive ministry reports of the history, status, struggles and blessings of the Lord into their respective lives and ministry purposes set before them. Following our “open agenda” ethos, extended times of prayer, worship and waiting on the Lord over flowed via the blessings, freedom and inspiration of the Lord in our midst! Conveners for the global Transform World events beginning with Indonesian in 2005 and through 2010 presented the status of the planning for review. In the process some of the dates were readjusted. Korean leaders sent a report relating to the Korean Transform world event planned for 2007. III. What were the Outcomes Recognition that this movement is of the Lord. Strong affirmation that there be no global earthly structure! Persons and/or entities involved operate out of their own legal structure, as directed by their own boards, leadership and/or ministry constituency. That there is be “open participation” in the activities of this movement with each person who affirms that Jesus Christ is Lord and/or entity operating out of their own anointed/appointed “call of the Lord,” as evidenced via adherence to the Word of God. That commitment is joyfully given to “seek and observe” what God is doing, that we might join in the missio Dei, God’s mission versus, our own pre-conceived earthly definitions of our own doing. That we all be rooted in the love of God – sensing the compelling call of God to “Love our neighbor!” This ethos extends itself into the “bonding, love and respect of one another!” This fellowship is truly “THE STRUCTURE” under which we operate (vs. earthly hierarchical and/or legal structure of man’s making!)

    "title": "The AD2000 Movement - A Catalytic Study",
    "content": "The AD2000 Movement - A Catalytic Study Luis Bush The catalytic nature of the AD2000 Movement, as a contextual and institutional platform for a vibrant world evangelization effort during the final decade of the second millennium incorporates sections based on catalytic aim, catalytic means, catalytic leaders and catalytic structures. AD2000 provides a contextual and institutional platform for demonstrating the constancy of the nature of catalytic impulses that come from conferences, renewal, and unique leaders seeking the glory of God. The AD2000 case study shows that, to the degree that a world evangelization movement draws catalytic impulses from an appropriate goal, structure, leadership and means, is the degree to which the movement itself becomes a servant-catalyst in mission. The introduction of the paper describes the birth of AD2000 and the methodological approach for fashioning the aim and vision. The first section deals with visionary goal. The second section develops the structural dimensions of AD2000. The third section describes the leadership. The fourth section reviews the catalytic means utilized in AD2000. The conclusion provides an assessment of AD2000. I. An Introduction to AD2000 During the second half of the twentieth century, many Christian leaders and organizations perceived some new moves of God around the world and called for special prayer and consideration of these moves. From this period of prayer and reflection, AD2000 developed during the late 1980s. Its primary purpose was to encourage existing and new movements to work together across prevailing barriers, in order to advance the cause of Jesus Christ and his Great Commission. The movement grew as more and more individuals and entities worldwide joined the cause in which they would collaborate in the vision of a church for every people and the gospel for every person by the year 2000. A. The Birth of AD2000 AD2000—a catalyst with a servant theme—was born to strategize, encourage, network, inspire, research, and disseminate information about what the Holy Spirit is doing through the church globally. Its stated purpose: in a spirit of servanthood, to encourage, motivate and network men and women church leaders, by inspiring them with the vision of reaching the unreached by the year 2000 through consultations, prayer efforts and communication materials. The intention was to encourage cooperation among existing churches, movements, and structures to work together towards this same vision. “A Church for Every People and the Gospel for Every Person by AD 2000” became the rallying cry. To what extent did AD2000 serve catalytically to precipitate and increase the rate of reaction of the Great Commission process to advance the Christian movement? Assessing this and the means and principles it used can only be of great interest to us as we consider the future of the world Christian Movement of the twenty-first century. B. The Setting: A Key Moment in History AD2000 arose for such a time as this. The year 2000 became a magnet for a convergence of trends with related expectations. For example, Health for All 2000 was a World Health Organization (WHO) initiative with its theoretical roots in the Alma Ata Declaration 1978, which focused on physical health for every human being by the end of the year 2000. The three aims were: (1) The development of alliances and networks within the community, (2) the integration and delivery of health promoting activities, and (3) the promotion of the health of primary care staff (Fletcher 2001). C. The Shaking of the Nations The fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 symbolized a dramatic turning point in human history. The break- up of the former Soviet Union, the movement of some nations toward democracy, the migration of hundreds of thousands of refugees across national borders, the intensification of tribalism and nationalism have altered the geo-political landscape. The dismantling of the old Soviet Empire under the centralized authoritarian regime resulted in a proliferation of nations open to new ideas. One of the consequences is that since 1990, the United Nations (UN), up to this time, had grown twenty-eight percent in number of member nations. It was as though God were shaking the nations, giving access to Christian messengers in a way that had not happened in a hundred years. The contextual conditions surrounding the end of the second millennium served to provide a suitable platform to launch a global Christian movement. In addition, the year 2000 became a giant magnet for all of mankind. ... Download PDF for full article: The-AD2000-Movement-A-Catalytic-Case-Study-by-Luis-Bush.pdf",

    "title": "The Incredible Meaning of the AD2000 Movement",
    "content": "The Incredible Meaning of the AD2000 Movement Rick Wood Many people, especially in America, think of missions and world evangelization as an American led and promoted enterprise. But today in our time God is doing some earth shaking things around our world that are breaking down the usual stereotypes about missions. Today the number of missionaries from the third world is growing rapidly and far outstripping the number of new missionaries from the U.S. heading to the field. It is estimated that there will be 160,000 missionaries from the third world by the year 2000. That is almost 4 times the current number of U.S. missionaries. Hundreds of new third world mission agencies have sprung up in the last 20 years. The AD 2000 And Beyond Movement, led by third world leaders, is bringing the third world and American mission efforts together under the banner of &quot;A church for every people and the gospel for every person by the year 2000.&quot; The AD 2000 Movement is a unique international organization involving thousands of the world&#39;s pre- eminent mission and church leaders who are working together as never before to see the world reached in the next nine years. The Leaders The present leaders of this world-wide movement are Thomas Wang, the Chairman/Founder, and Luis Bush, the International Director. Both of these men are international leaders from &quot;third world&quot; countries. Dr. Wang is originally from China and Rev. Bush was born in Argentina and raised in Brazil. Thomas Wang The AD 2000 Movement Chairman, Thomas Wang, was born in Beijing, China, October 14, 1925. By the age of 28 he had become actively involved in the Lord&#39;s work beginning as a local preacher in Taipei. By the age of 32 he had become an international evangelist. After founding and directing the Chinese Christian Mission for 15 years, Thomas was asked to found the Chinese Coordination Centre of World Evangelism (CCCOWE), networking some 5,000 Chinese churches in the diaspora. In this capacity he served for another 10 years, until invited to be the office of International Director of the Lausanne Committee for World Evangelization (LCWE) in January 1987. After writing an article called By the year 2000: Is God trying to tell us something? he began to see the need to focus even more intensively on the fulfillment of the Great Commission in this decade. And so he has fathered and chairs another movement, the AD 2000 and Beyond Movement. Luis Bush Born in Argentina, Luis spent much of his growing up years in Brazil where his father was in business. While in the Argentine military service he and his wife accepted Christ. After completing Dallas Seminary, he served as pastor in El Salvador for seven years. In 1984 he organized a missions conference for Central America where over 1000 delegates attended from 18 countries and a brush fire for missions emerged. Even after he became president of Partners International, he continued as coordinator for COMIBAM, the continent wide missions conference held in Sao Paulo in 1987. The momentum of that mission movement has spilled over into a vision for the world and now his role as International Director of the AD 2000 Movement. Alvin Low Dr. Alvin Low was appointed last year to be the Associate International Director of the AD 2000 and Beyond Movement. Dr. Low was born in Malaysia and received his Doctor of Theology in 1985 from Dallas Theological Seminary. Alvin wil work closely with Luis Bush, the International Director, and will operate from the AD 2000 office in Colorado Springs, Colorado. Before coming to the AD 2000 and Beyond Movement, Alvin worked as Vice-President of Ministries of International Students Inc.. John Richard John is the Associate International Director of the Global Consultation On World Evangelization II (GCOWE II) scheduled for June 1994. John was born in Rangoon, Burma to Christian parents. After WW II his family moved to India. In 1966 John moved into full time Christian work with the Evangelical Fellowship of India and eventually became their General Secretary as well as that of the Evangelical Fellowship of Asia. He has also served with the Asian Evangelical Fellowship and on the Executive Council of the World Evangelical Fellowship (WEF) and the Lausanne Committee for World Evangelization. He is currently serving on WEF&#39;s Commission on Church Renewal. In September 1990 John accepted the invitation to serve as the Associate International Director of GCOWE II for &#39;94. Its Origin and Purpose The AD 2000 and Beyond Movement grows out of a desire to respond both to the imperative of the Great Commission and to the unique opportunity to mobilize all of God&#39;s people to reach the unreached by the year 2000, as God&#39;s people everywhere have established unprecedented faith goals for AD 2000. By July 1990, researchers reported more than 2000 evangelization plans focused on the year 2000. One third of these are from the two-thirds-world. With all the interest in the year 2000, it became apparent that the worldwide body of Christ needs to coordinate its efforts for world evangelization. It is exciting to realize that much of the AD 2000 goals can be reached by mobilizing people in existing ministries without adding another complex and expensive infrastructure. The following purpose statement was developed in consultation with around 350 Church leaders from all over the world. The overall purpose is stated as follows: In a spirit of servanthood the people involved in the AD 2000 Movement seek to encourage, motivate and network men and women church leaders by inspiring the vision of reaching the unreached by AD 2000 through consultations, prayer efforts and written materials. The intention is to encourage cooperation among existing churches, movements and structures to work together towards this same vision. The expected result is the establishment of a mission-minded church planting movement within every unreached and unevangelized people and city by AD 2000, so that all people might have a valid opportunity to experience the love, truth and saving power of Jesus Christ in fellowship with other believers. The focus of this movement is on reaching the approximately two billion unreached people who are not within reach of Christians of their own ethnic or people group and do not yet have a vital, indigenous church movement. People refers to the larger ethno- linguistic groups, estimated to be 2,000 among which there are an estimated 11,000 smaller people groups. The Structure The two key words for the AD 2000 Movement are, &quot;motivate&quot; and &quot;network.&quot; The two main avenues of sharing the vision are through &quot;national consultations&quot; and &quot;common interest groups.&quot; The focus of the structure is upon a national, regional, and global strategy. National Structure The goal of the AD 2000 Movement is to see spiritual initiatives in 200 countries around the world. As of December 31, 1991, interdenominational Christian leaders in over 65 countries around the world have held AD 2000 vision meetings or AD 2000 consultations. (See the chart below.) The initiative and perspective of a national AD 2000 movement comes from the national leaders. Typically, informed by the global process, national Christian leaders take the initiative to set their own goals focused on the year 2000. The form and focus that the movement takes depends on the perspective of these national leaders. The national AD 2000 plans are responsive to the call of Scripture to reach the unreached as well as the political and economic realities within each of the individual countries where these plans are developed. The sharing of vision comes through consultation as Christian leaders gather in national or regional consultations to share what God is doing around the world. The leaders from these countries involved in these consultations would include pastors, denominational leaders, Christian organizational leaders, training institutional leaders, women, young people, and lay people. These national initiatives are formed as national leaders with a vision for the year 2000 form Ad Hoc Steering Committees to bring Christian leaders together to develop and implement mobilization strategies for the national, regional, and global levels. The Global Networks Along with these country-wide and regional spiritual initiatives, there are 14 global initiatives by interest groups networking together to concentrate on each vital element needed for the cause of world evangelization. Each track is charged with mobilizing the existing forces for evangelism and uniting them, not organizationally, but in prayer, in mutual respect, in interpersonal relationships, and in support of one another through sharing of ideas and resources, to prevent overlap and competition. Within the overall purpose of the AD 2000 and Beyond Movement, each of the interest networks has their own purpose, goals and objectives as they prepare for GCOWE II in 1994. One aspect that underscores the AD 2000 networks is the partnership established between different Christian leaders representing many countries of the world. Each global network typically includes in its leadership one person from the west and one from a two-thirds-world country. As these global network representatives identify, select and recruit regional network representatives, a core group of 12, representing all ten major regions of the world, will come into existence. As each of the regional network representatives select, identify and recruit two representatives for the country, the internationalism of the process becomes increasingly evident. These global AD 2000 initiatives by interest groups are seeking to: Network church leaders for an intensive effort of world evangelization by AD 2000. Intensify, galvanize and accelerate vision for world evangelization within that interest group. Facilitate information exchange between tracks and all interested parties. Encourage cooperative relationships with existing movements, networks and structures that result in coordinated efforts to evangelize unreached peoples and urban centers. Foster concentrated, prevailing prayer against the obstacles for world evangelization. The Prayerful Outcome As Christians work through separate but cooperative programs, the AD 2000 Movement hopes that the body of Christ would realize these outcomes. Mobilization of united prayer efforts in every country of the world. Engagement in cooperative ministry efforts to reach the 2000 unreached clusters of peoples. Revitalization of the church leaders for lay mobilization and church renewal. Establishment of an evangelical congregation within easy access of every person in the world. Penetration and evangelization of the unevangelized world by creative missionary methods, such as non-residential missionaries, tent-makers, international returnees and sports evangelism. Equipping of key leadership in every country to develop and implement an effective cross-cultural missionary training program. Establishment of permanent national missiological research functions in every country of the world. Assessment of the progress of evangelization among the 2000 unreached peoples. Engagement in cooperative ministry efforts to reach the 2000 unreached peoples. Provision of a valid opportunity for every person to hear the Gospel in a language they can understand. Establishment of a church planting movement within every unreached people group and city in the country or region. The development of the innate and spiritual gifts of God&#39;s people everywhere, and in particular, women and young people for world evangelization. Conclusion The AD 2000 Movement is a dynamic institution tailor made to meet the latest trends in missions. It is tapping into the tremendous surge of interest around the world in giving all people everywhere the opportunity to receive Christ as savior by AD 2000. It is also a movement that is raising up international leadership from dozens of countries. AD 2000 is a unique global mission enterprise motivated and carried forward at the initiative of thousands of people from all over the world who have God&#39;s heart to see all peoples reached. These are people who desire to work together to see the job completed more rapidly and easily than if they worked separately. It is important for the western church to take this movement seriously as the third- world begins to take over the leadership of the mission movement to penetrate every people group with the gospel by the year 2000. But it is still not too late for the church in America to get mobilized into this world-wide movement. Some 170 countries at Lausanne II in 1989 expressed in the final paragraph under the 11th affirmation of the Manila Manifesto -- &quot;We commit ourselves to evangelize the world during the last decade of this millennium. There is nothing magical about the date, yet should we not do our best to reach this goal? Christ commands us to take the gospel to all.&quot; And certainly if D.L.Moody were in our midst he would add: &quot;It can be done, it ought to be done, it must be done!&quot; Article source: http://www.missionfrontiers.org/issue/article/the-ad2000-movement",

    "title": "World Inquiry Argentina: The Wind of the Spirit Blows in the Midst of a Secular Storm",
    "content": "World Inquiry Argentina: The Wind of the Spirit Blows in the Midst of a Secular Storm Rino Bello, Hugo Baravalle Organized by: ACIERA: Christian Alliance of Evangelical Churches in the Argentine Republic The World Inquiry was conducted in the cities of Buenos Aires and Rosario by Luis Bush in January 2002 and then facilitated at the Encounter for Pastors for the Evangelization of the Nation (ENPEN) which took place in the city of Mar del Plata April 9 to 12. For two and a half hours Bush, Rino Bello and Jorge Ibarbalz facilitated the World Inquiry among more than 1500 Christian leaders registered for ENPEN who represented the entire country, including the cities, towns and rural areas. The World Inquiry was very positive, and the analysis of the information revealed the challenges the church needs to meet in the power of the Holy Spirit for the evangelization of the nation. The World Inquiry was a valuable instrument for ENPEN where the participants gathered precisely to study the strategies and methodologies for evangelization which the Inquiry helped to clarify. As a result of the Inquiry in Mar del Plata, various representative leaders from the provinces and cities of Argentina are planning to conduct the survey in their own cities and provinces with whom we are in close contact to assist with the follow-up. We have no doubt, that in this moment of national crisis in this afflicted nation, God is moving His people in the “supreme task of the church: the evangelization of the world.” I. Argentina’s Background in Brief The deep-rooted effects of the Spanish colonization extend to our present time, and after Argentina’s independence in 1810 the Spanish and Italian influx has been even greater. In the wake of World Wars, I and II many European immigrants arrived in the country -in addition to Spaniards and Italians, there came peasants from Russia, Poland, Germany and other Eastern European countries. Because of this blending of races, Argentina became a predominantly European country, both ethnically and culturally. Until the 1940s, Argentina’s stability, economy, educational level, and social welfare conditions positioned the country amongst the world’s first seven. A progressive decay settled in and the social and economic conditions in the country, deteriorated in a downhill trend that reaches up to our present time, when worldwide statistics rank Argentina amongst the under developed countries, in spite of other statistics that still rank the country in certain favorable positions (e.g. the United Nations Economic Development Administration, UNEDA, Human Development Index). {Índice de Desarrollo Humano del PNUD – Programa de Naciones Unidas para el Desarrollo} The last 30 years have seen a sharp decline, no matter if governments were military or democratic. The country’s experience throughout the last 11 years has been this deep and inevitable crisis for which no one seems to find a way out. Christian sociologist Hilario Wynarczyk puts it this way: “In reality it appears that deregulation, the term used by the theorists of neo liberalism for the elimination of any kind of state controls or regulations upon the market for ideally attaining the much-desired free market conditions, has escaped the boundaries of its economic and political application to introduce itself in all social areas. In Argentina, not only the market but also the opposition, the political parties, the [Roman] Catholic Church and the unions have been steered and regulated by certain actors. Now, the failure of economic deregulation and the reappearance of state controls have also caused the fall of other controls and the paradoxical increase of social deregulation. The hegemonic actors are losing control as new actors and forms of expression enter the stage. The “cacerolazos” [“pan beatings”] that have characterized popular discontent amongst Argentineans have given way to a new style of protesting, at a time in which a transition is occurring, from a merciless capitalism to a nationalism that has no idea as to where or what it is heading for. The truth is that the number of poor, jobless and hungered is appallingly on the increase while a host of rich actors do not know how or where to spend their wealth as they make all possible efforts to get their money out of the country. What could we say regarding the thousands (or millions perhaps) of people, especially youths and professionals, who have decided to leave this country and paradoxically return to the lands of their forefathers? Undoubtedly, the tunnel is dark and there are those who say they can see a feeble light in the distance - some say it is the exit; others say it is the train coming in the opposite direction... II. The Evangelical Church in Argentina The evangelical presence dates back to the colporteurs and the courageous independent missionaries that gave their lives for the sake of the Gospel more than 150 years ago. There were many of them, and it would be unfair to name some and not others. The historical churches were the first to settle in the country. The influence of Anglicans and Methodists was great in the early stages of the new country. Other denominations came in during the early 1900’s. But the evangelical church really started developing in the 1950’s, with the Pentecostal groups taking the lead. The 1970’s brought about charismatic renewal movements that resulted in major changes - most of them very positive - within the national leadership. Throughout the last 20 years, the evangelical leadership affirms expressions of unity, evangelism, discipleship, missions, and more recently of social responsibility. We see the rising of national evangelists, large churches, congresses, conferences, Bible seminaries, specific ministries, etc. In the 1980’s the country saw a multiplication of evangelistic crusades throughout the nation and in a diversity of approaches - mass evangelism, one-to-one, through radio, TV, etc. Nevertheless, the 1990’s were characterized by a slow-down and it seemed that the church had come to a sort of “plateau,” which gave way to less evangelistic activities such as concerts, praise rallies, etc. The 1990’s also saw a substantial development of foreign mission work, prompted by a one-equal-to-one exchange rate for dollars-pesos, which lasted 11 years. Although there is an evangelical presence in every province in Argentina, the same thing cannot be emphatically stated regarding every town or village in the country. One most certainly will find evangelical churches in the big cities, but there are many small—and not so small—towns that have no evangelical witness established there as of yet. One of the most controversial issues and one that poses many difficulties for reporting exact figures is that of the number of evangelical Christians in the country. Research carried out by reliable ministries shows that evangelicals make up for a 4 to 6 % within a total population of 37 million. Others say that the figures should be closer to 8 or 10 %, although this would be the result of including not only church members but also those who could be considered “sympathizers” and those who “at some time - perhaps once only - attended an evangelical church.” The impression a foreign visitor might get is that Argentina has “mega-churches,” if we take into account that there are church buildings with a seating capacity for 2,000+ and that these same churches feature up to 3 services every Sunday. On the other hand, it is also true that typical local congregations with an average membership of 200 or 300 members or less have lately experienced a decline in their membership and attendance, due to a steady exodus of members who emigrate from the country; and this is a serious problem that makes it difficult to provide honest figures. It is also necessary to take into account the importance of the charismatic movements, which formerly were almost exclusively related to Pentecostal groups and at present are being experienced in many non- Pentecostal denominations. This Evangelical “ecumenism” has undoubtedly done the church at large a lot of good, while at the same time has fostered concern and even ill feelings amongst the traditional groups. All this strives to put in a nutshell the fact that during the past 20 years the church in Argentina has experienced a “stir of the Spirit” that may well turn into a “revival.” Our reflection at this point is: Is it possible to experience a “revival” if the situation in the country is so difficult? The straightforward answer is, YES, IT IS POSSIBLE! We believe that the church in Argentina is like the woman ready to give birth described in 2 Kings 19:3: They told him: &quot;This is what Hezekiah says: This day is a day of distress and rebuke and disgrace, as when children come to the point of birth and there is no strength to deliver them.” This situation of distress, rebuke and disgrace that was described above in I., we need to recognize and identify as ours, with a humble and repentant heart. Accepting reality means that, knowing our weakness, we might design the best strategies to tackle the task in the most effective manner. In short, let us turn the difficulty into an opportunity, and let us dream! Let us dream about a Church that has received a visitation of the Holy Spirit and is ready to give birth to a Revival. Today we face a difficult transition point. On one hand, there is toil and pain because the “children come to the point of birth and there is no strength to deliver them,” and on the other we have the “children [that have] come to the point of birth.” We should like to identify these “children” as the revival that God wants to pour out over Argentina in a way that we have never experienced before, and our present birth pains are a natural part of this process of giving birth. The Argentine church is “pregnant” with God’s stir made manifest in these last 20 years, but the children that are coming is something much greater, it is REVIVAL! Our dream today is to feel pregnant with this vision of revival. For this, we need to strengthen our commitment to: The Lord Jesus Christ The Church, Christ’s body, living out a respectful unity Evangelization and discipleship Church planting Home and foreign missions Care programs Theological education for ministers Penetrating all areas of society, including the political arena It is possible that at some point in the next 20 years a report be written regarding this time, which will reflect a nation that has emerged from its crisis, with the birds that had to emigrate coming back to their homes here, with Christians serving in key public leadership positions, and more. The church making up for a real 25 to 30 % of the population; missionaries in the most distant locations in the world; evangelists going throughout the nations of the world with the good news. The name that is above all names, JESUS CHRIST, exalted. All this will come to pass if we are capable of standing our present pain, and if under the power of the Holy Spirit we “push” to deliver the children. We have described the reality of the secular Argentina, the Church, and the dreams and commitments of the pregnant Church. We bless the church and the nation, in the certainty that the children - revival! - will come, because “there is the sound of a heavy rain&quot;: And Elijah said to Ahab, &quot;Go, eat and drink, for there is the sound of a heavy rain.&quot; So, Ahab went off to eat and drink, but Elijah climbed to the top of Carmel, bent down to the ground and put his face between his knees. &quot;Go and look toward the sea,&quot; he told his servant. And he went up and looked. &quot;There is nothing there,&quot; he said. Seven times Elijah said, &quot;Go back.&quot; The seventh time the servant reported, &quot;A cloud as small as a man&#39;s hand is rising from the sea.&quot; So, Elijah said, &quot;Go and tell Ahab, ‘Hitch up your chariot and go down before the rain stops you.’ “Meanwhile, the sky grew black with clouds, the wind rose, a heavy rain came on and Ahab rode off to Jezreel. The power of the LORD came upon Elijah and, tucking his cloak into his belt, he ran ahead of Ahab all the way to Jezreel. (I Kings 18:41-46). World Inquiry for the Cities of Argentina The Argentine gathering was a great blessing in the midst of a serious national economic, political and social crisis. Argentine key facilitator for the Bill Kennedy, said: &quot;We have truly lived a miracle of the Lord having received confirmation of over 1500 participants covering the 23 provinces of Argentina and all the major denominations of the 3 mayor umbrella groups. God is turning this into a Historical time. May we all be conscious and ready to be found obedient in all that He gives us through this time, so special for our nation.” It was called “an encounter of pastors” and was sponsored by CNEC, a new fraternal entity combining the three major Christian Church leadership structures in the country. The event was hosted at the beautiful three-tiered theatre now church in the coastal city of Mar del Plata. The purpose of this event was to consider the way forward for the evangelization of the country. ENPEN as it became known, provided continuation for the Amsterdam 2000 event led by the Billy Graham Association. As a result of the World Inquires held in January in the city of Buenos Aires and Rosario the national organizing committee included it in the program as they considered it be a useful tool for reflecting together on “where to go from here in the evangelization of Argentina.” The interest in ENPEN exceeded early expectations of the organizers. Actually, not many weeks prior to the event CNEC seriously considered canceling the gathering as there were less than 100 people registered. However, the problem became providing transportation. World Help, an organization based in Virginia led by Vernon Brewer who is partnering with the World Inquiry, came through with funds for ten buses. According to Ruben Proietti, a key leader of CNEC, the timing was such that it opened the gates for others who were waiting to see what would happen. By the beginning of the first morning of the conference, about 1500 key pastors, denominational, mission, lay and women leaders registered for ENPEN from all of the 23 provinces. From the beginning of our time together there was a powerful sense of the presence of the Lord. On the first morning of the conference, following the devotional, two- and one-half hours were set aside for the World Inquiry in the plenary session. The actual facilitation of the Inquiry was conducted by two of the members of the organizing committee. They encouraged the leaders from the cities to return and organize a world inquiry with Christian leaders in their own city. The compilation of the results of the focus group meetings by city provided a significant picture by city and for the entire nation of what the servants of the Lord are sensing in their spirits God is saying at this time.

    "title": "World Inquiry Purpose Process People Paradigm Emerging",
    "content": "World Inquiry Purpose Process People Paradigm Emerging Luis Bush Jesus said to his followers, in reference to God the Father: “Seek first his kingdom and his righteousness” (Mt. 6:33a). Seeking the Kingdom of God results in personal and cultural transformation which has emerged as a unifying vision for the mission of the Church at the beginning of the twenty-first century. God is on a mission of transformation. A global transformation movement has begun. It&#39;s God&#39;s movement. This book reports on some of the contributions, the considerations, the context and conclusions regarding transformation as mission. The thesis of this book is that God is calling His servants to act as catalysts in mobilizing the whole body of Christ to bless the nations through the transformation of people, churches and culture. Almost three years ago I began a journey in the listening mode. The World Inquiry, short for Evangelizing our World Inquiry, was born out of a simple desire to hear what God was saying to his people. An e-mail in August of 2000 from Paul McKaughan, President of the Evangelical Fellowship of Mission Agencies, prompted me to embark on this quest by a personal e-mail when he wrote: I don&#39;t know of any time in my 35 years of mission experience that l has seen or felt mission executives readier and more willing to change and adapt. At the same time, l also doesn’t know of any period in my career that there is less certainty about what changes to make. The future is uncertain. We know it will be greatly different but are not sure in which ways it will be different. We know that the patterns of the past are showing &quot;wear&quot; and are in need of repair. In many ways the fit between our strategies and way of thinking does not fit our present reality well. We know that they probably won&#39;t move us into the future God has for us. Yet the new paradigms that help us interpret and organize our strategies for the future have not become clear. We seem to be in a time of parenthesis between what God blessed in the past and what He has not yet made clear for the future. The interest in taking “the journey of the listening mode” was further enhanced during the final months of the year 2000. An abiding question in my own mind was: Where do we go from here in world evangelization? The encouragement of my fifteen-year accountability/support group led me to reflect on this question by means of a doctoral study at the former Fuller School of World Mission, now School of lntercultural Studies (Fuller) under the active and able oversight of Wilbert Shenk, Chuck Van Engen and Sherwood Lingenfelter. While looking through the lenses of the Scriptures, theology, missiologists, church history, global mission conferences, the AD2000 Movement and Christian leadership, it soon became clear that the focus of the dissertation, which was completed May 2002, would more appropriately be on informing the question, rather than seeking to provide answers. And so, began a quest to know the mind of God through the burdens, visions and dreams of his people as we move into the future. A World Inquiry compressed the reflective process into a practical instrument. The World Inquiry started out as an exercise to probe the minds and hearts of evangelical leaders in the major cities of the world. The Inquiry began and has continued not as a rigorous, methodologically-driven research project, but rather a &quot;listening venture&quot; that sought to tune in to God&#39;s voice through His people, especially those voices and leaders who are now emerging onto their local, regional and national scenes in the Two-Thirds World. L was reminded of the words of John Stott in his book titled: Christian Mission in the Modern World, “Life is a pilgrimage of learning, a voyage of discovery, in which our mistaken views are corrected, our distorted notions adjusted, our shallow opinions deepened and some of our vast ignorance&#39;s diminished.” As we listened to one another and sought God through His Word to hear what the Spirit was saying to the Church, we saw streams of church and mission emerging on the periphery of mainline ecclesiastical and mission structures; we shared the visions on the hearts of God&#39;s servants; and we heard from respected missiologists as to what fresh missiological paradigms are emerging. Fuller Theological Seminary sponsored the World Inquiry, providing advice at various stages of the research, design and conduct of the inquiry process. It was conducted in collaboration with the Lausanne Committee on World Evangelization, with a view to a presentation of the findings at this World Evangelization Issues Forum. This brings this journey of the listening mode through the World Inquiry to an end. The preliminary findings were presented, reviewed and discussed in May 2003 in Seoul, Korea by an International Coalition of 120 missiologists, practitioners, and church and mission leaders chaired by Sang-Bok David Kim. ...

    "content": "AD2000 International Office is Closed The AD2000 &amp; Beyond Movement was formed to encourage, motivate, and network men and women church leaders by inspiring them with the vision of accelerating the reaching the unreached through the year 2000. We believe that God has used the AD2000 and Beyond Movement to do that and to mobilize the Church to focus more on the unreached peoples in the 10/40 Window and around the world. This has been done through consultations, prayer efforts, national initiatives, functional tracks and task forces, and communication materials. It has been the intention of the Board of Directors right from the beginning that the International Office of the movement would close after the year 2000. Their vision for the movement included closing it down so that other ministries and structures would pick up the challenge and carry the work forward beyond anything the AD2000 and Beyond Movement could do. This is happening through many national movements as well as in many ministries and churches working together toward reaching the unreached. Therefore the International Office closed early in 2001. Although AD2000 may no longer be able to answer personal inquiries, our web site offers resource lists and links to others who may provide the information you need. We encourage you to visit the Joshua Project II website for the latest unreached peoples data and profiles. Joshua Project II is continuing and expanding the original Joshua Project initiative by highlighting least reached peoples through information sharing and networking. The Resource section of the Adoption Guidance Program may prove especially beneficial. They are poised to encourage you and to assist your efforts to focus on the world&#39;s least reached peoples.

    "content": "Cancellation of Celebrate Messiah 2000 CM2000 Cancellation Update Dear Colleagues: You have not been out of my thoughts, since I sent you the email on Monday, with the news of the cancellation of the Celebrate Messiah Conference in Jerusalem. Thank you, to so many of you, who have written, phoned, and emailed with a positive response and the assurance of your present and continued prayers. I send this now because I want you to know the actual steps that we have taken, and will continue to take, to ensure that you receive the maximum return of your money, and that all aspects of cancellation of the Conference and return of monies are dealt with properly. We have met with the Tour Companies, who were responsible for hotel bookings and other arrangements. All the hotels we were going to use, have agreed to no cancellation charge, and to return 100% of any monies advanced to them. The Tour Company is keeping some funds advanced to pay for expenses already incurred, but it is much less than we expected. Praise God! The International Convention Centre, where the Conference was going to be held, have agreed to return all monies, less a small fee for &#39;administration&#39; costs already incurred. There are no costs incurred in the arranging of Tours before and after the Conference; thus, these will be returned 100%. The majority of delegate fees are held in a Trust Fund, set up by the Tour Operators, here in Israel. I go tomorrow to sign papers, and then they have promised to &#39;Bank Transfer&#39; all the monies they are holding to the AD2000 bank account in Colorado Springs. They are also taking responsibility for collecting the monies that the hotels and Convention Centre have promised to return. What this means is that AD2000 will be able to return monies as follows to all delegates: All Land and Tour monies will be returned All Registration fees will be returned less irrevocable costs, which have been incurred. Where delegates have incurred substantial penalties from their airlines for ticket cancellation, AD2000 will entertain hardship requests to seek to help financially as we are able. During the next few weeks, we have asked Regional and National Coordinators to clarify with each delegate the amount that they believe they are owed. We will then check/verify our figures for funds received. Once that is done, we will begin to return the monies due. Our target date for this is the week commencing January 8th. Please continue to pray for all this and for our staff through this process. A news item concerning the cancellation has been put on our website. It finishes by saying: &#39;The Internet news a few weeks ago announced &#39;Bethlehem cancels Christmas&#39;. The Celebrate Messiah Conference in Jerusalem may also be cancelled, but we know that this Christmas time, we have a Savior whose name is Jesus, and that He is the Savior of the world. Christmas cannot and never will be cancelled. Thanks be unto God!&#39; In His limitless love, Luis bush International Director AD2000 &amp; Beyond Movement Article source: http://www.ad2000.org/celebrate/cancel3.htm",

    "content": "Borrador Revisado del Manifiesto del Milenio Nosotros, los 1600 participantes y representantes de 110 naciones nos hemos reunido en Jerusalén al final del milenio para celebrar a Jesús el Mesías. Nos regocijamos con todos los creyentes de ésta tierra de promesa, con Judíos Mesiánicos y con Arabes Cristianos, porque el evangélio del reino ha sido predicado desde Jerusalén a todas las partes de la tierra. Hoy día, Dios recibe gloria y alabanza de más gente, naciones y lenguajes que en cualquier otro momento de la historia humana. Y nos regocijamos aún más, por que se acerca el día en que un movimiento reproductor de la iglesia existirá dentro de cada sociedad de la tierra que le proporcionará a cada persona, un testimonio claro, culturalmente sensitivo y en su propio idioma del evangélio de Jesús (Hab 2:14, Hechos 1:8). VALORES FUNDAMENTALES 1. FUNDAMENTOS Buscando obedecer la Gran Comisión, humilde y agradecidamente, reconocemos a aquellos que nos han precedido en la obra. Nos adherimos a las divinamente inspiradas Santas escrituras como la autoridad final para lograr un santo vivir, una enseñanza sólida y un servicio fructífero. Valoramos los credos clásicos de la Iglesia Antígua y los enunciados confesacionales de la Reforma. Afirmamos los documentos misiológicos y teológicos del movimiento evangélico moderno, incluyendo el Enunciado de la Fé del Consejo Evangélico Mundial (1951), el Pacto de Lausanne (1974), el Manifesto de Manila (1989), la Declaración de la Consulta Global sobre Evangelización Mundial (1995) y la declaración de Amsterdan (2000). No intentamos enmendar éstos documentos, sino hacer úso de sus perspectivas para aplicarlas a nuestro tiempo y a nuestra tarea. (2 Tim 3:16-17; 2 Ped 1:20-21) 2. EL DIOS TRIUNO Pactamos juntos el adorar al Dios Triuno: Padre, Hijo y Espíritu Santo. Afirmamos que la misión fluye de la naturaleza de Dios quién es el único que merece ser adorado por cada persona de cada cultura y lengua. La misión a la cual Nos llama es Su misión. El Padre, habiendo enviado al Hijo y al Espíritu, ahora envía a Su Iglesia a vivir y proclamar el evangélio a toda la gente, para cumplir Su pacto de gracia. (Mat 3:16-17, 12:28; Luc 1:35, 24:49; Juan 3:16-17, 14:2, 15:26, 16:17, 17:18, 20:21; 1 Cor 12:4-6; 2 Cor 13:14; Gál 4:6; 1 Juan 5:7) DIOS, EL PADRE Como creador y sostenedor de todo el mundo, Dios el Padre no hace responsables como mayordomos de su buena creación la cual ahora está caida y deformada por el pecado. Pactamosjuntos ahora no continuar abusándola ni destruyéndola, sino protegerla y preservarla. Nos comprometemos a trabajar por la paz y la justicia dentro y fuera de la Iglesia para afirmar la imagen de Dios en cada persona y la unidad de la raza humana. Por la gracia de Dios, responderemos a las denuncias de la injusticia, la pobreza, la guerra y la opresión con el alivio, el desarrollo, la defensa y cualquier otro medio digno de ser usado. Nos oponemos a la maldad de la violencia, la inmoralidad, la corrupción, el consumismo y la explotación que devalúe a la gente, promueva la injusticia, y abuse del mundo natural. (Gén 1:26-27; 3:17-19; Miq 2:8; Rom 8:19-21; Apo 4:11) DIOS, EL HIJO Afirmamos que Dios se ha revelado totalmente a Si Mismo en El Hijo, nuestro Señor Jesús Cristo, ofreciendo a todas las personas salvación eterna del pecado y de la muerte a través de la fé en El. reconocemos la suficiencia de Su sacrificio sin pecado y nos regocijamos en Su victoria sobre todos los poderes de maldad a traves de Su propia vida, su muerte, su resurrección y su ascensión, todo lo cual ocurrió en y alrededor de Jerusalén, ése mismo lugar donde estamos reunidos. Reconociendo los peligros del universalismo, del pluralismo religioso y del sincretismo religioso, proclamamos la singularidad de Jesús el Mesías como prefigurado en el Viejo Testamento, descrito en el Nuevo Testamento y como ha sido confesado por la Iglesia a traves de los siglos. Pactamos juntos, exaltarle a El tanto en nuestra vida personal como en nuestras comunidades para declarar Su gloria en medio de todos los pueblos a traves de dar testimonio con denuedo, servir con humildad y dialogar con sumo interes, todo marcado por un profundo respeto hacia los demás. (Juan 1:1, 1:18, 5:24, 17:3, 20:31; Hec 4:29, 31; Rom 9:5; 2 Cors 5:21; Gál 3:13; Fil 22:6; 2 Tim 2:24-26; 1 Ped 3:15) DIOS, EL ESPIRITU SANTO Dios, el Espíritu Santo, quién llenó a todos los discípulos en la ciudad de Jerusalén en el día de Pentecostés, convence al mundo de pecado y de justicia, aplica la obra salvadora de Jesús Cristo a las personas de manera individual, imparte vida nueva a traves de la fé en Jesús, santifica a los creyentes y los equipa con los dones de su gracia, motivando y dando poder en todo sentido a su testimonio en Jesús. Mientras sostenemos que el Espíritu Santo siempre ha estado presente en la Iglesia preservándola, guiándola y dándole poder, también afirmamos que en el siglo que acaba de pasar, un derramamiento particular del Espíritu Santo y un entendimiento Bíblico más profundo de Su mover, ha equipado a las iglesias con un despliegue misionera no igualado desde los dias de la iglesia primitiva. Aunque reconocemos la necesidad de seguir desarrollando una base Bíblica común para enseñar sobre el Espíritu Santo y sobre la práctica de Sus dones, nos comprometemos a realizar un servicio misionero más dependiente en Su poder y guía, en el próximo siglo. Pactamos juntos orar continuamente y trabajar sin descansar por el renovamiento y el avivamiento de la Iglesia a través de la obra del Espíritu Santo que genere misiones para todo el mundo. (Juan 16:13-15; Hec 2:4; 2 Cor 3:6; 1 Juan 2:27) 3. EL EVANGELIO El evangélio son las buenas nuevas del Reino de Dios el cual incluye el perdón de los pecados, una nueva vida en la comunidad de la fé, el regalo del Espíritu y la esperanza eterna que estan disponibles a toda persona y a todo pueblo. Por lo consiguiente, nos comprometemos a predicar un evangélio completo. Rechazamos divorciar lo espiritual de lo secular, nuestra relación con Dios de nuestra relación con nuestro vecino y nuestra salvación eterna de nuestra existencia temporal. Y rechazamos cualquiera dicotomía entre el crecimiento de la iglesia y la salud de la iglesia, y el evangelismo y la responsabilidad social. Sin embargo, afirmamos la prioridad de un evangélio que reconcílie a la gente con Dios. y aún cuando la preocupación social y el servicio compasivo son parte esencial de nuestra misión, el objetivo primordial es el hacer discípulos de Jesús Cristo, discípulos que entren en el Reino de Dios a través de la fé y que vivan como Sus seguidores ahora y para siempre. (Isa 52:7; Mat 4:23, 9:35, 16:26, 28:19; Luc 24:19; Hec 10:38; 1 Cor 15:3-5; Gál 3:26) 4. MISION Dios quiere que todas las personas tengan la oportunidad de llegar a ser verdaderos dicípulos de Jesús dentro de su propio contexto socila e idiomático. Por lo tanto, entrando la Iglesia en el nuevo melenio, pactamos trabajar juntos por un movimiento misionero de alcance mundial que le dé a cada persona en cada grupo étnico en el mundo, una oportunidad de oir, entender y responder durante su vida; el ser incorporado a la vida de una congregación local, crecer en una creciente intimidad con Dios, manifestar la vida de Cristo y exhibir el fruto del Espíritu como la sal y luz del mundo, y para recibir poder para ministrar efectivamente tanto en la Iglesia como en el mundo. (Mat 5:13-14; Rom 16:26; 1 Cor 12:13; Rom 16:26; 1 Cor 12:13; Gál 2:20, 5:22-23; Col 1:28; 2 Ped 3:18; Apo 5:9-10) 5. EQUIPOS A medida que el evangélio alcanza más lugares y personas, y la Iglesia aumenta en número, pactamos juntos para buscar la edificación de los creyentes en el crecimiento, el discipulado, la fé u el conocimiento. Apoyamos todo esfuerzo que se haga para proveer varios niveles de entrenamiento para que cada iglesia pueda tener evangelistas, pastores y maestros equipados y en maduración, y que cada misión pueda tener un liderazgo pionero adecuado. Reconocemos la importancia de que el evangelismo mundial tenga una sólida base misiológíca. Por lo consiguiente, incentivamos a que las iglesias, instituciones y organizaciones coloquen al evangelismo y a las misiones transculturales en el mismo núcleo del curriculum total de la educación cristiana y del entrenamiento misionero. Solicitamos que haya un entendimiento teológico balanceado en las iglesias que no sólo incluya estructuras congregacionales, sino también estructuras educacionales y misioneras, (Efe 4:11-13). 6. CONFLICTO ESPIRITUAL La misión cristiana implica tanto el conflicto espiritual como el encuentro con la verdad. La noción secular sobre un mundo puramente material ha sido desacreditada por el retorno de millones de personas a la práctica de viejas y nuevas formas de religión, animismo, magia y hechicería. Y por lo tanto muchos viven bajo el temor y la esclavitud de las fuerzas malignas. Pactamos juntos el afirmar y anunciar el poder de Jesús Cristo para liberar a aquellos que sufren bajo el yugo de poderes y creencias opresoras. Nos comprometemos a orar por tales personas y a oponernos a toda manifestación de esas operaciones malignas en los individuos, estructuras sociales , filosofías, ideologías y religiones. Y al hacerlo, proclamamos sin embargo firmemente la absoluta autoridad y poder de Jesús para liberar y proteger a todos Sus seguidores del daño espiritual a medida que renunciámos al diablo y a todas sus obras. Nos guardaremos de que aún los mismos Cristianos sean moldeados por perspectivas mundiales no Cristianas, tanto en el pensamiento como en la práctica, para que no sucumban al mismo temor que es vencido a traves de la fé en Jesús. (Juan 8:31-32, 36, 17:17; 2 Cor 10:4-5; Efe 4:27, 6:10-18; San 4:7; 1 Ped 5:8-9). 7. PERSECUSION Estamos conscientes de que en el siglo 20 han ocurrido más persecusión, acoso, discriminación y asesinatos de Cristianos que nunca antes en la historia. Reconocemos que la persecusión y el sufrimiento no son sólamente parte de la vida Cristiana, sino que también son oportunidades para dar testimonio con denuedo del evangélio en el poder del Espíritu. Afirmamos el derecho de la Iglesia de proclamar el evangélio en palabra y en obras, a toda persona, en todas partes. Rechazamos toda forma de proselitísmo y de presión manipuladora, pero proclamamos el derecho de cada persona de llegar a ser seguidores de Jesús como respuesta a la convicción del Espíritu Santo. Pactamos juntos a resistir persecusiones y adversidades a causa del evangélio, para apoyar con oración y defender a los Cristianos perseguidos y a usar cada oportunidad para disminuir su sufrimiento. (Mat 5:11; Mar 13:13; Hec 4:19, 5:29; Heb 13:3; 1 Ped 4:12-13). 8. UNIDAD Sabemos que la Grán Comisión no puede ser cumplida hasta que los Cristianos del Norte, Sur, Este y Oeste no se asócien para compartir recursos y dar un testimonio conjunto a todo el mundo. Por lo tanto, reconociendo que el centro de gravedad de la Cristiandad se ha sido trasladado de aquellas tierras consideradas Cristiana desde hace tiempo para llegar ser un fenómeno global, celebramos “la nueva gran realidad “ de que las misiones cada vez más viene desde todos los pueblos hacia todos los pueblos. Nos comprometemos a facilitar ésta sociedad de iguales a todo nivel de liderazgo e iniciativa, y a a poyar nuevas iglesias y ministerios a medida que desarrollan formas de vida eclesiástica, teología, testimonio y misiones culturalmente apropiadas. Renunciándo a la competencia, duplicación, dominio y aislamiento, buscamos ser embajadores de reconciliación como el ilustrado por la asociación de negros y blancos Surafricanos en el liderazgo de la Consulta Global sobre Evangelismo Mundial en 1997 y de los Judíos Mesiánicos con los Arabes Cristianos para el evento de Celebra al Mesías 2000. Nos unimos a los esfuerzos para crear una plataforma común de apoyo continuo a las misiones, como los de la recientemente creada Mesa Redonda de la Gran Comisión. Creemos en una diversidad de ministerios dentro de un Cuerpo universal y pactamos juntos para hacer todo esfuerzo que demuestre la unidad en el Espíritu en el vínculo de la paz . (Esd 3:1; Sal 133:1-3; Rom 12:5, 15:5-6; Gál 3:28, 5:26; Efe 4: 3-5 ) TEMAS PLENARIOS 9. HISTORIA De pié al borde del nuevo milenio y en ésta hora decisiva para la misión, pactamos juntos edificar sobre la labor de los pioneros quienes nos han precedido, incluyendo los fieles dentro del pueblo Judío. No nos atrevemos a jactarnos en contra de las raices que nos nutren, ni del árbol en el cual hemos sido injertados. Celebramos a Jesús quién entregó su vida para unir a miembros de todos los pueblos en uno, redimiendo a todo lo que es precioso y único en su cultura. Honrámos al Apóstol Pablo quién no suministró el más duradero modelo para transplantar la fé de una cultura a otra sin comprometer al evangélio. Recordámos a los mártires cuya sangre nutrió la semilla de la iglesia a través de los siglos. Reconocemos las comunidades monásticas, eruditos y misioneros que llevaron la luz del evangélio a través de las edades. Tenemos en alta estima a los hombres y a las mujeres que atravesaron las barreras entre la Iglesia y el mundo entrando en nuevas tierras, penetrando fronteras culturales y forjando nuevos paradigmas para las misiones en un mundo cambiante. Le damos gracias a Dios por aquellos que despertaron a la Iglesia del siglo veinte a la realidad de todos aquellos pueblos no alcanzados y que reconocieron que estábamos en el amanecer de las Misiones Cristianas. (Isa 51:1; Hec 7:59-8:1, 10:44-46, 17:22-32) h3p&gt;10. EL CORAZON DE LA TIERRA BIBLICAh3/p&gt; El conflicto que continúa afectando ésta región donde estamo reunidos, también afecta nuestros corazones. Y por éso, tomamos coraje de las palabras de dos sorprendidos discípulos que regesáron de Emaús: “Ha resucitado el Señor verdaderamente...” Y ahora al comienzo del 3er milenio, Judíos Israelíes, Musulmanes y Cristianos nominales en el corazón de la tierra bíblica estan recibiendo éstas Buenas Nuevas y dando fruto genuino. Honramos el hecho que varias iglesias han sembrado la semilla y han servido a las personas de ésta tierra a través de los siglos. Nos regocijamos de que en la última parte del siglo veinte, muchas congregaciones Mesiánicas han sido establecidas. Los Musulmanes han mostrado creciente interés en el Evangélio y han florecido asambleas internacionales. Y todo ésto ha ocrrido a pesar de la oposición, amenazas y penalidades muy parecidas a aquellas enfrentadas por la iglesia del primer siglo. Y de éstas y de otras maneras, la Iglesia en la tierra Santa es un microcosmos de los que es La Iglesia es a nivel mundial. Por ello, pactamos juntos a orar para que la iglesia del corazón de la tierra bíblica en sus expresiones Judío Mesiánica, Palestina y Cristiano internacional pueda crecer rícamente y proclamar con poder éste asombroso mensaje a los confines de la tierra: “ Cristo ha resucitado, de veras!” (Gén 12:1-3, 22:18,26:24, 28:14; Mar 16:15; Luc 24:33-34, 47-48; Hec 3:25; Gál 3:8) 11. ADORACION La adoración es tanto una forma de vivir como un evento en el cual participar. En y a traves de la alabanza, centramos todo nuestro ser en Dios, humildemente glorificándole a El en respuesta a Sus atributos, Sus acciones y Su Palabra. La adoración es teológica, práctica y estratégicamente primordial para nuestras vidas personales y para la vida de la Iglesia. Pactamos juntos el someter todo nuestro ser a Dios, pidiéndole a El que despierte nuestra conciencia por Su santidad, nutra nuestra mente con Su verdad, purifique nuestra imaginación con Su belleza, abra nuestro corazón con Su amor, y nos permita rendirnos totalmente a Su propósito. Pactamos juntos en unidad y cooperación, a completar la tarea de establecer comunidades de discípulos adoradores de Jesús en todo pueblo. Adicionalmente, afirmamos el privilegio de cada pueblo a emplear todo elemento digno de su lengua madre y cultura para adorar al Dios triuno, personal y coorporativamente, en espíritu y en verdad. ( 1 Cró 16:29; Sal 33:3, 95:6, 100:2; Mat 4:10; Juan 4:24; Col 3:23-24; Apo 7:9-12) 12. ORACION Y AVIVAMIENTO Abrazamos la promesa y el propósito bíblico de Dios para exaltar a Su Hijo como Redentor-Rey en todos los pueblos a través de Su Iglesia despertada. En éste dia de oportunidad sin precedente en el evangelismo mundial, tomamos confianza del propósito de Dios para hacer avanzar el Reino de Cristo en el mundo. Pactamos juntos el orar y prepararnos para un avivamiento personal y coorporativo, sabiendo que nustra esperanza no es en vano. Creemos que el avivamiento es un patrón evidente a través de la Bíblia y de la historia de la iglesia. Dios es fiel y consistente en todos Sus caminos: lo que El ha hecho antes, El es capáz y está dispuesto a hacer nuevamente en nuestra generación. Reconocemos que el Avivamiento de la iglesia puede transformarla de una manera única para que pueda enfrentar los extraordinarios retos misioneros que tiene por delante. Nos regocijamos en que el Espíritu esta dispensando un despertar en la oración por las naciones sin precedente en la Iglesia, sabiendo que Dios Mismo está comprometido a escuchar y responder sus oraciones. Y resolvemos unirnos entusiásticamente a éste movimiento de oración mundial, confiando en que Dios nos dará la visitación de Su Espíritu para que mueva a los individuos y a las iglesias a cumplir la Gran Comisión. (2 Cró 7:14; Job 16:20-21; Sal 80:3, 85:4-7; Isa 64:1-12; Rom 8:34; Heb 7:25; Joel 2:12-17; Hab 3:2; Efe 3:18, Apo 11:15 y 12:10-11) 13. LA IGLESIA MAYORITARIA En el amanecer del tercer milenio, la mayoría de los Cristianos viven en Asia, Africa y America Latina. Nos regocijamos en la vitalidad espiritual presente en éstos continentes que son el hogar de la mayoría de las personas que se estan entregando a Cristo por primera vez. Los grandes campos de la cosecha del ayer han llegado a ser las fuerzas que hoy están haciendo la gran cosecha, con la iglesia mayoritaria enviando más de la mitad de los misioneros Protestantes del mundo. En las décadas recientes, se ha levantado un liderazgo excelente proveniente de la iglesia mayoritaria para servir a los movimientos evangélicos globales, y para generar iniciativas y movimientos de plantío de iglesias nacionales que han dado resultados notables. Muchas agencias misioneras internacionales han movido sus cuarteles a las grandes ciudades de Asia para poder nutrirse de los vastos recursos humanos y materiales de las iglesias de esa región. Las iglesia de Corea del sur y de Sudáfrica han sido anfitriones exitosos a dos consultas globales principales GCOWE ‘95 y ‘97 respectivamente, proporcionando habitación, comida y logística. Las asociaciones y redes de trabajo más exitosas para alcanzar a los no alcanzados estan funcionando dentro de las regiones de la iglesia mayoritaria, donde la tecnología y las finanzas se han mezclado con la efervecencia espiritual, fé, elasticidad y fortaleza numérica. Reunidos aquí en Jerusalén de todas las iglesias del este. oeste, norte y sur, nosotros por lo tanto pactamos juntos el reconocernos como iguales, a tenernos el uno al otro en alta estima, y a trabajar juntos para avanzar el Reino de Cristo en todos los pueblos. ( 1 Cro 12:32; Mat 9:36-38; 1 Tim 3:1-13; 3 Jn 5-9) 14. LOS POBRES Y LOS NECESITADOS Nos regocijamos en que el pueblo de Dios está llegando a ser cada vez más sensible a las necesidades de los pobres así como Jesús, el Campesino de Nazaret, mostró una profunda preocupación por los pobres. Hoy la iglesia de la mayoría es en sí pobre, por lo tanto el ministerio dirigido hacia los pobres, será un ministerio con los pobres y a través de los pobres. Nos regocijamos en la emergencia de organizaciones y de redes de trabajo que promuéven ministerios totales, internacionales y transforma- dores de comunidades, especialmente en las areas económicamente deprimidas del mundo. Estamos, sin embargo, agudamente conciente de las enormes deficiencias sociales y espirituales que afectan a los millones de pobres y necesitados. Reconocemos que nosotros que vivimos en las regiones más ricas del mundo, somos culpables de materialismo, injusticia e indiferencia que nos han llevado a cometer pecados de comisión y de omisión en contra de los pobres. En profundo arrepentimiento, pactamos juntos unirnos a los pobres para romper las cadenas de la injusticia y la opresión, compartiendo los recursos que Dios nos ha dado a todos nosotros, y llevando el evangélio del reino el cual es buena nueva tanto para ricos como para pobres. (Isa 58:6-7; Sal 69:33; Prov 14:31; Mat 5:1-12; Luc 4:16-20; Gál 2:10; San 1:27, 4:17). 15. EL PAPEL DE LA MUJER Nos regocijamos en que las mujeres de todo el mundo estan experimentando una visitación especial de Dios. Estan despertando a su derecho de nacimiento y herencia, confiando en Dios para cumplir todo Su propósito en y a través de ellas. Estan aprendiéndo cada vez más a seguir la dirección de Su Espíritu, a medida que descubren su valor intrínsico, no en los imperativos culturales, geográficos y generacionales, sino en el conocimiento de que están hechas a la imágen y semejanza de Dios. El Creador, quién diseñó tanto al varón como a la hembra para reflejar Su semejanza y gloria, llama a hombres y mujeres a servir como compañeros iguales en Su propósito. Nosotros por lo tanto, pactamos juntos a buscar reconciliación y justicia no sólo con relación a la raza y las clases, sino también con relación al género. A medida que nosotros los hombres y las mujeres aprendemos a caminar y a trabajar juntos en respeto mutuo y devoto respeto, seremos una vez más libres para servir el plan y propósito de Dios en los términos de la contribución especial de cada uno. (Jue 4:4; Ru 1:16-17; 1 Sam 1:11; Joel 2:28-29; Luc 2:36, 8:3; Jn 20:11-18; Hec 9:36, 16:13-14, 21:8; Rom 16:12) 16. LIDERES EMERGENTES En los últimos 50 años, líderes jóvenes y valientes han plantado muchas iglesias y agencias misioneras que han enviado decenas de miles de misioneros alrededor del mundo. Estos líderes ya estan en sus años de vejez y algunos ya se han graduado de gloria. El manto de autoridad está siendo ahora transferido a una generación más jóven de líderes quienes estan cumpliendo su responsabilidad con denuedo. La voz unificada de éstos líderes emergentes supera las barreras de nacionalidad, lenguaje, cultura, género, denominación y teología. A través de múltiples canales de comunicación e interacción, éstos jóvenes líderes han hecho salir a la superficie, un claro conjunto de valores y prioridades. Encuentran su identidad en la visión y el llamado, no en las organizaciones. La intimidad con Cristo sumado a la alabanza y adoración son los valores primordiales. Un profundo anhelo por la unidad de todo el cuerpo de Cristo empuja a éstos jóvenes líderes a superar diferencias denominacionales y doctrinales dentro de la tradición evangélica. Desean que líderes maduros sean sus mentores y les den su perspectiva para trabajar en unidad y así completar la gran comisión. Nosotros por lo tanto, pactamos juntos a apoyar a los líderes emergentes a quienes Dios ha levantado, a alentarlos en sus sueños, y a dejar espacio para el desarrollo de sus dónes, ideas e iniciativas. ( Dan 3:16-18, 28; Joel 2:28; 1 Tim 4:12, 5:1; Tito 2:6; 1 Ped 5:5; 1 Jn 2:13-14) 17. PUEBLOS NO ALCANZADOS Alabámos a Dios por el épico progreso en la investigación, listado y creación de los perfiles de los pueblos no alcanzados. Nos regocijamos porque todos los grupos de lo pueblos no alcanzados de más de 10.000 personas han sido perfilados y adoptados. Apreciamos profundamente las respuestas de las iglesias y de las agencias que se han movilizado en oración, liderizando iniciativas nacionales, y comisionando equipos para establecer iglesias nativas entre los pueblos no alcanzados. Como resultado de ésta acción, el número de pueblos que no tienen una congregación nativa de al menos 100 personas se está reduciendo cada vez más y más. Por una parte, lamentamos que el objetivo de que hubiese una iglesia por cada pueblo y que el evangélio se haya predicado a cada persona, no se haya logrado en el año 2000. Lamentamos, también, que se le haya dado una atención tan mínima a los niños, quienes constituyen uno de los grupos de gente más significativos del mundo. Pero por otra parte, celebrámos los lógros del Movimiento AD 2000 y Más Allá, y encomendámos ésta tarea a aquellos que lo continuarán. Pactamos juntos a promover su cumplimiento. ( Gen 22:18; Sal 72:17; Isa 19:25, 52:15; Rom 15:20; 2 Ped 3:9) 18. INICIATIVAS NACIONALES Nos regocijamos en que, durante la década pasada, las iglesias de muchos paises desarrollaron estrategias y procesos nacionales a fín de mobilizar al Cuerpo de Cristo para completar la tarea incompleta dentro y fuera de sus fronteras. Líderes siervos y visionarios han facilitado iniciativas nacionales que reafirman las estructuras existentes y que alientan los compromisos de cooperación para plantar iglesias hasta la saturación y para crear un movimiento pionero de siembra de iglesias dentro de cada pueblo etno-linguista. Alabamos a Dios porque en ésta década, los esfuerzos unido de Su pueblo ha dado mucho fruto. Y todavía hay mucho trabajo por hacer. Por lo tanto, oramos por el devenir del dia en que todas las personas tengan una oportunidad válida para experimentar el amor, la verdad y el poder salvador de Jesús Cristo en comunión con otros creyentes de su propio pueblo. Alentamos al pueblo de Dios en todas partes a desempeñar su papel en establecer un movimiento para sembrar iglesias con mentalidad orientada hacia las misiones dentro de cada pueblo no alcanzado. Pactamos juntos el buscar y descubrir el rol de Dios para cada uno de nosotros en Su propósito, sin importarnos el costo. ( 2 Sam 24:24; Jn 3:7-9; Hec 13:43-44, 18:9-11; Rom 1:8, 10:18, 16:19; 2 Ped 3:9; 1 Tes 1:8; 1 Tim 2:4 ) 19. TRANSFORMACION DE COMUNIDADES Entrando al nuevo milenio, presenciamos al Espíritu de Dios visitando la tierra de una nueva y dinámica forma. Dios está permitiendo tremendas aperturas espirituales en ciudades, regiones y nacio- nes. Su presencia y poder estan tocando y transformando cada esfera de la vida humana - espiritual, política, económica y social - con un cambio visible y medible, y con multitudes viniendo a la salvación en Cristo. Las claves de tal transformación comunitaria son la oración y el liderazgo perseverante. Oraciones enfocadas, fervientes, orientadas al futuro, llenas de fé y efectuadas por líderes humildes y con mentes afines quienes se atreven a creer que Dios tiene algo “ inmensurablemente mejor ” para esa ciudad. Comenzando por Su iglesia, Dios está estremeciendo viejas estructuras y forjando nuevos paradigmas y patrones de ministerio para enfrentar los retos de un mundo que cambia rápidamente. Usando el instrumento de la investigación diagnóstica, la Iglesia puede hacer un perfil de la comunidad para responder de manera significativa tanto a las necesidades determinadas como a las necesidades espirituales verdaderas de dicha comunidad. Los planes de acción específica incluyen: establecer nexos con los guardias de las puertas de la ciudad a traves de eventos de oración anual; eventos de oración catalítica coorporativa; involucramiento contínuo de la base de la iglesia en oración; evangelismo de servidumbre a traves de actos de bondad sin exigir nada a cambio; reconciliación social; infraestructura de células de oración evangelística ó grupos pequeños en hogares, sitios de trabajo, escuelas ó campuses para “pastorear” a la comunidad; enfrentamientos públicos de poder en contra de las fuerzas espirituales que atan y ciegan a los perdidos; y eventos de cosecha que alcancen a toda la ciudad y que involucren a todo individuo ó institución que esté dispuesta a actuar en el día de la demostración de su Poder! Por lo tanto, resolvemos mirar nuestras ciudades a través de los ojos de Cristo y a servir a nuestras comunidades con el corazón y la humildad de El. Pactamos juntos para trabajar por la reparación de nuestras comunidades, restaurar la dignidad de los pueblos, reestablecer sus fortunas, renovar sus esperanzas, revivir sus espíritus y redimir vidas en el poder del amor de Cristo! ( (Sal 110:3; Isa 59:16; Eze 3:17; 2 Cor 4:4; Efe 3:20-21, 6:12; San 5:16 ) 20. ASOCIACIONES GLOBALES Afirmamos que las asociaciones son una parte importante del evangelismo mundial. Construimos relaciones de confianza para poder trabajar en sociedad, para ver comunidades de creyentes en Cristo en todos los pueblos que le van a adorar. Hay una pregunta fundamental sobre misiones que debe cambiar desde “Que puedo hacer?” a “Como puedo insertarme en lo que otros están haciendo?”. Las asociaciones pueden ayudárnos a responder ésta pregunta y proveer un fóro para lograr colaboración práctica. En las últimas dos décadas, hemos visto un nuevo amanecer en el pueblo de Dios por todas partes. Nos regocijamos en las muchas docenas de asociaciones internacionales que estan emergiéndo y operando por el bién de los pueblos no alcanzados. Creemos que éste esfuerzo es agradable a Dios, consistente con Su carácter y con la misión de la iglesia. Sin embargo, tenemos todavía un gran reto delante de nosotros. Estas asociaciones no emergerán ni operarán sin gente que tenga la visión, habilidad y compromiso tanto con el propósito como con el proceso de la asociación. Pactamos juntos, por lo tanto, a alentar a la Iglesia global a identificar, recrutar, entrenar y apoyar a los facilitadores de las asociaciones. (Exo 17:12; Jue 20:1; 1 Sam 4:6-7; 1 Cro 12:22-38; Neh 3:1-32; Mat 18:19-20; Luc 5:17-20; 1 Cor 12:12, 20-27; Luc 5:17-20; 3 Jn 8) En la conclusión de éste histórico evento y en respuesta a la gracia de Dios, ahora volvemos a entregarnos al Mesías encarnado, crucificado, resucitado, ascendido, exaltado y quién retornará. Nos abandonamos sin reserva a El y a Su causa. Al hacerlo, sabemos que sufriremos el riesgo de granjearnos la ira del mundo que nos rechaza como le recharazaron y le crucificaron a El. Sin embargo, Su Gran Comisión no es una mera opción a ser considerada sino un mandato a ser obedecido. Por lo tanto, a la luz de su segunda venida, pactamos juntos, por la capacitante gracia de Dios, a luchar por la meta de toda la Iglesia de llevar el Evangélio completo, a todo el mundo. En éste siglo, buscaremos establecer un movimiento reproductor de iglesias en cada tipo y clase de gente y dentro del alcance práctico de cada persona para que cada segmento de la sociedad sea permeado con el amor, compasión, verdad y poder salvador de Cristo, el Mesías. Que toda la tierra sea llena con la gloria del Dios Triuno! La novia de Cristo y el Espíritu dicen a Aquel que viene pronto: Ven! Amén. Ven, Señor Jesús. (Sal 96:3; Mat 28:18-20; Jn 12:24, 13:34-35, 15:18-19; Rom 6:13, 12:1; 1 Cor 6:19-20; 2 Cor 5:20; Apo 22:20). In English Article source: http://www.ad2000.org/celebrate/spanmani.htm",

    "title": "The Millennial Manifesto: Covenanting for the 21st Century",
    "content": "The Millennial Manifesto: Covenanting for the 21st Century We, the 1,700 registrants representing 106 nations, intended to gather in Jerusalem at the turn of the millennium to celebrate Jesus the Messiah. Although divine wisdom prevented us from meeting together with believers in Israel, the land of promise, including Messianic Jews, as well as Arab and Israeli Christians, we rejoice that the gospel of the kingdom has now spread from Jerusalem to all parts of the world. God now receives glory and praise from more peoples, nations, and languages than at any other time in human history. Furthermore, we rejoice that the day is within sight when a reproducing church movement will exist within the social structure of every people group on earth, providing every person in his or her own language with a clear and culturally sensitive witness to the gospel of Jesus. ( Hab 2:14; Ac 1:8) FOUNDATIONAL VALUES 1. FOUNDATIONS In seeking to obey the Great Commission, we humbly and gratefully acknowledge those who have gone before us. We adhere to the divinely inspired Holy Scriptures as the ultimate authority for godly living, sound teaching, and fruitful service. We value the classical creeds of the Ancient Church and the confessional statements of the Reformation. We affirm the theological and missiological documents of the modern evangelical movement, including the World Evangelical Fellowship Statement of Faith (1951), the Lausanne Covenant (1974), the Manila Manifesto (1989), the Global Consultation on World Evangelization Declaration (1995) and the Amsterdam Declaration (2000). We do not aim to amend these documents but to make use of their insights as they apply to our time and task. (2 Ti 3:16-17; 2 Pe1:20-21) 2. THE TRIUNE GOD We covenant together to worship the Triune God: Father, Son and Holy Spirit. We affirm that mission flows from the nature of God who alone deserves to be worshipped by every person of every culture and language. The mission to which He calls us is His mission. The Father, having sent the Son and the Spirit, now sends His Church to live and proclaim the gospel among all peoples, thus fulfilling His covenant of grace. (Mt 3:16-17, 12:28; Lk 1:35, 24:49; Jn 3:16-17, 14:2, 15:26, 16:7, 17:18, 20:21; 1 Co 12:4-6; 2 Co 13:14; Gal 4:6;.4:6; 1 Jn 5:7) GOD THE FATHER As creator and sustainer of the whole world, God the Father holds us responsible as stewards of his good creation, which is now fallen and marred through sin. We covenant together not to further abuse or destroy it, but to protect and preserve it. Affirming the image of God in every person and the unity of the human race, we pledge to work for peace and justice within and beyond the Church. By God&#39;s grace, we will respond to the outcries of injustice, poverty, war and oppression with relief, development, advocacy and all other worthy means. We oppose the evils of violence, immorality, corruption, consumerism and the exploitation that demeans persons, promotes injustice, and abuses the natural world. (Ge !:26-27; 3:17-19; Mic 2:8; Ro 8:19-21; Rev 4:11) GOD THE SON We affirm that God has fully revealed Himself in His Son, our Lord Jesus Christ, offering all persons eternal salvation from sin and death through faith in Him. We acknowledge the sufficiency of His sinless sacrifice and rejoice in His victory over all evil powers through His own life, death, resurrection and ascension, all of which took place in and around Jerusalem, the very place where we would have gathered. Recognizing the dangers of universalism, religious pluralism and syncretism, we proclaim the uniqueness of Jesus the Messiah as prefigured in the Old Testament, portrayed in the New Testament and confessed by the Church through the centuries. We covenant together to lift Him up both in our personal lives and in our communities and to declare His glory among all peoples by bold witness, humble service and earnest dialogue, each marked by genuine respect for others. (Jn 1:1, 1:18, 5:24, 17:3, 20:31; Ac 4:29, 31; Ro 9:5; 2 Co 5:21; Gal 3:13; Php 2:6; 2 Ti 2:24 - 26; 1 Pe 3:15) GOD THE HOLY SPIRIT God the Holy Spirit, who filled all the disciples in this city of Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost, convicts the world of sin and righteousness, applies the saving work of Jesus Christ to individual persons, grants new life through faith in Jesus, sanctifies believers, equips them with His gifts of grace and both motivates and empowers in every context their witness to Jesus. While we affirm that the Holy Spirit has always been present in the Church preserving, guiding and empowering her, we also affirm that in the century now past, a particular outpouring of the Holy Spirit and a deeper, more biblical understanding of His work has equipped the churches for a missionary outreach not equaled since the days of the early church. While we recognize the need for further developing a common biblical basis for teaching and practice with regard to the Holy Spirit and His gifts, we commit ourselves in the next century to missionary service more wholly dependent on His power and guidance. We covenant together to pray continuously and work tirelessly for the renewal and revival of the Church through the work of the Holy Spirit, resulting in missions to the world. (Jn 16:13 -15; Ac 2:4; 2 Co 3:6; 1 Jn 2:27) 3. THE GOSPEL The gospel is good news of the Kingdom of God which includes the forgiveness of sins, new life in the community of faith, the gift of the Spirit and eternal hope available to every person and for all peoples. Therefore we covenant together to proclaim a holistic gospel. We refuse to divorce the spiritual from the secular, our relationship to God from our relationship to our neighbor, our eternal salvation from our temporal existence. And we reject any dichotomy between church growth and church health, evangelism and social responsibility. Yet we affirm the priority of evangelism that reconciles people to God. While social concern and compassionate service are essential parts of our mission, the primary goal is to make disciples of Jesus Christ, disciples who enter the Kingdom of God through faith and live as His followers now and forever. (Isa 52:7; Mt 4:23, 9:35, 16:26, 28:19; Lk 24:19; Ac 10:38; Ro 1:16;1 Co 15:3-5; Gal 3:26) 4. MISSION God wants all persons to have the opportunity to become true disciples of Jesus within their own social, cultural, and language context. Therefore, as the Church enters the new millennium, we covenant to work together for a worldwide mission movement that will give every person in every segment of the human mosaic an opportunity to hear, understand and respond to the gospel during his or her lifetime; to be incorporated into the life of a local congregation, to grow in ongoing intimacy with God, to manifest the life of Christ and exhibit the fruit of the Spirit as salt and light in the world; and to be empowered to minister effectively both in the Church and in the world. (Mt 5:13-14; Ro 16:26; 1 Co 12:13; Gal 2:20, 5:22-23; Col 1:28; 2 Pe 3:18; Rev 5:9-10) 5. EQUIPPING As the gospel reaches more places and peoples and the Church grows in numbers, we covenant together in seeking to build up believers in nurture, discipleship, faith and knowledge. We support every effort to provide various levels of training so that every church may have equipped and maturing evangelists, pastors and teachers, and that every mission may have adequate pioneering leadership. We recognize the importance of solid missiology in world evangelization. Therefore, we appeal to churches, organizations and institutions to place evangelism and cross-cultural missions at the very core of the total curriculum of Christian education and missionary training. We call for a balanced theological understanding of the church that includes not just congregational structures, but also missional and educational structures as well. (Eph 4:11-13; 2 Ti 2:2; Jude 20) 6. SPIRITUAL CONFLICT Christian mission includes both spiritual conflict and truth encounter. The secular notion of a purely material world has been discredited as millions return to old and new forms of religion, animism, magic and witchcraft. Many thus live in fear of and bondage to evil forces. We covenant together to affirm and announce the power of Jesus Christ to liberate those who suffer under oppressive beliefs and powers. We commit to pray for such persons, and to oppose every manifestation of evil operating in individuals, social structures, philosophies, ideologies or religions. In doing so, however we uphold firmly the absolute authority and power of Jesus to free and protect all His followers from spiritual harm as we renounce the devil and all his works. We will guard against Christians themselves being molded by non-Christian worldviews in their thinking and practice, and thus succumbing to the same fear that is overcome through faith in Jesus. (Jn 8:31-32, 36, 17:17; 2 Co 10:4-5; Eph 4:27, 6:10-18; Jas 4:7; 1 Pe 5: 8-9) 7. PERSECUTION We are aware that in the twentieth century there has been more persecution, harassment, discrimination and killing of Christians than ever before in history. We acknowledge that persecution and suffering are not only part of the Christian life, but also an opportunity for bold witness to the gospel in the power of the Spirit. We affirm the right of the Church to proclaim the gospel in word and deed to everyone everywhere. We reject all forms of coercive proselytism and manipulative pressure, but uphold the right of persons to become followers of Jesus in response to the conviction of the Holy Spirit. We covenant together to endure persecution and hardship for the sake of the gospel, to support prayerfully and defend persecuted Christians, and to use every opportunity to relieve their sufferings. (Mt 5:11; Mk 13:13; Ac 4:19, 5:29; Heb 13:3; 1 Pe 4:12-13) 8. UNITY We know that God desires that the Great Commission be fulfilled by Christians in the North, South, East and West, as they partner together by sharing resources and giving a common witness to the entire world. Therefore, acknowledging that Christianity&#39;s center of gravity has shifted from lands long considered Christian and has become a global phenomenon, we celebrate &quot;the great new fact&quot; that mission increasingly is from all peoples to all peoples. We pledge to facilitate this partnership of equals at every level of leadership and initiative and to support new churches and ministries as they develop culturally appropriate forms of church life, theology, witness and mission. Renouncing competition, duplication, domination and isolation, we seek to be ambassadors of reconciliation as illustrated by the partnership of black and white South Africans in the leadership of the Global Consultation on World Evangelization, 1997 and of Messianic Jews with Arab Christians at Celebrate Messiah 2000. We embrace efforts to create a common platform for ongoing cooperation in mission, such as the newly formed Great Commission Roundtable. We believe in diverse ministries in one universal Body and covenant together to make every effort to demonstrate the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace. ( Ezr 3:1; Ps 133:1-3; Ro 12:5, 15:5-6; Gal 3:28, 5:26; Eph 4:3-5) CONTEMPORARY REALITIES 9. HISTORY Standing on the brink of a new millennium and in this decisive hour of mission, we covenant together to build upon the labors of the pioneers who have gone before, including the faithful among the Jewish people. We dare not boast against the roots that support us, the tree into which we have been grafted. We celebrate Jesus who gave his life to unite members of all peoples in one, redeeming all that is precious and unique in their culture. We honor the Apostle Paul who provided for us the most enduring model for transplanting the faith from one culture to another without compromising the gospel. We remember the martyrs whose shed blood nourished the seed of the church through the centuries. We recognize the monastic communities, scholars and missionaries who advanced the light of the gospel down through the ages. We esteem highly men and women who crossed barriers both in the Church and in the world by entering new lands, penetrating cultural frontiers, and forging new paradigms of missions in a changing world. We are aware that they like us have had their defects and shortcomings but this does not in any way minimise our sincere gratitude to God for using them to awaken the twentieth century Church to the reality of the unreached peoples and to open our eyes to the fact that we were in the sunrise of Christian missions. (Isa 51:1; Ac 7:59 - 8:1, 10:44 - 46, 17:22 - 32) 10. THE BIBLICAL HEARTLAND The turmoil that continues to trouble this region where we intended to gather also troubles our hearts. Yet we take courage from the words of two amazed disciples from Emmaus: &quot;It is true! The Lord has risen!&quot; Now at the beginning of the 3rd Millennium, Israeli Jews, Muslims and nominal Christians in the Biblical heartland are receiving this Good News and bearing genuine fruit. We honor the many churches that have sown the seed and served the peoples of this land over the centuries. We rejoice that, in the latter part of the 20th century, many Messianic congregations have been established. Muslims have shown increasing interest in the Gospel and international assemblies have flourished. All this has occurred despite opposition, threats and restrictions much like those the first-century church faced. In these and other ways, the church in the Holy Land is a microcosm of the Church worldwide. Therefore, we covenant together to pray for the church of the Biblical heartland in its Messianic Jewish, Palestinian and international Christian expressions that it may grow richly and proclaim with power this amazing message to the ends of the earth: &quot;Christ is risen, indeed!&quot; . (Ge 12: 1- 3, 22:18; 26:4; 28:14; Mk 16:15; Lk 24:33-34, 47-48; Ac 3:25; Gal 3:8) 11. WORSHIP Worship is both a life to live and an event in which to participate. In and through worship, we, by grace, center our whole being on God, humbly glorifying Him in response to His attributes, His acts and His Word. We covenant together to submit our entire being to God, asking Him to awaken our conscience by His holiness, nourish our mind with His truth, purify our imagination by His beauty, open our heart to His love, and enable us to surrender fully to His purpose. We affirm that unity and cooperation are necessary to complete the task of establishing worshipping communities of Jesus&#39; disciples among every people. Furthermore, we affirm the privilege of each people group to employ all worthy elements of their mother tongue and culture as they worship the Triune God both individually and corporately, in spirit and truth.( 1 Ch 16:29; Ps 33:3, 95:6, 100:2; Mt 4:10; Jn 4:24; Col 3:23,24; Rev 7:9-12) 12. PRAYER AND REVIVAL We embrace God&#39;s biblical promise and purpose to exalt His Son as Redeemer-King among all people through His awakened Church. In this day of unprecedented opportunity in world evangelization, we draw confidence from God&#39;s purpose to advance Christ&#39;s Kingdom in the world. We covenant together to pray and prepare for personal and corporate revival. We believe that revival is a divine pattern evident throughout Biblical and church history. God is faithful and consistent in all His ways: what He has done before, He is able and willing to do again in our generation. We recognize that Revival in the Church can uniquely transform her and make her equal to the extraordinary mission challenges facing her. We rejoice that the Spirit is granting throughout the Church on behalf of the nations a remarkable prayer awakening, often accompanied by fasting. Knowing that God Himself is committed to hear and answer our prayers, we resolve to join enthusiastically in this worldwide prayer movement, trusting God for the visitation of His Spirit that will move individuals and churches to fulfill the Great Commission. ( 2 Ch 7:14; Job 16: 20 -21; Ps 80:3, 7,14-19; 85:4 - 7; Isa 64:1-12; Joel 2:12-17; Hab 3:2; Eph 6:18; Rev 11:15, 12:10-11) 13. THE MAJORITY CHURCH At the dawn of the third millennium, most of the world&#39;s Christians live in Asia, Africa and Latin America. We rejoice at the spiritual vitality present in these continents that are home to most of the people currently turning to Christ for the first time. Yesterday&#39;s great harvest fields have become today&#39;s great harvest forces, with the majority church now sending out more than half of the world&#39;s Protestant missionaries. In recent decades, excellent leadership in the majority church has arisen to serve global evangelical movements, and to generate national initiatives and whole nation church planting movements with notable results. Many international mission agencies have moved their headquarters to the great cities of Asia in order to draw upon the vast human and material resources of the churches in that region. The churches of South Korea and South Africa successfully hosted two major global consultations, GCOWE &#39;95 and &#39;97 respectively, providing accommodation, meals and excellent logistics. The most successful partnerships and networks for reaching the unreached are functioning within the regions of the majority church, where technology and finance blend with spiritual fervency, faith, resilience and numerical strength. We, who represent the churches in the east, west, north and south, therefore covenant together to recognize each other as equals, to esteem one another highly, and to work together for the advance of Christ&#39;s Kingdom among all peoples. (1 Ch 12:32; Mt 9:36-38; 1 Ti 3:3:1-13; 3 Jn 5-9) 14. THE POOR AND NEEDY We rejoice that God&#39;s people are becoming more and more sensitive to the needs of the poor even as Jesus, the Peasant of Nazareth, showed deep concern for the poor. Today the majority of the Church is itself poor. Ministry to the poor will therefore be a ministry by and with the poor. We rejoice in the emergence of organizations and networks that promote holistic, incarnational and community-transforming ministries, especially in the economically deprived areas of the world. We are, however, keenly conscious of the enormous social and spiritual ills affecting millions of the poor and needy. We acknowledge that both rich and poor are guilty of covetousness, injustice and indifference leading to sins of commission and omission. In deep repentance, we covenant together to join with the poor in breaking the chains of injustice and oppression, sharing with all the resources that God has given us, and spreading the gospel of the kingdom which is good news for rich and poor alike.(Isa 58:6-7; Ps 69:33; Pr 14:31; Mt 5:1-12; Lk 4: 16-20; Gal 2:10, 6:10; Jas 1:27, 4:17) 15. THE ROLE OF WOMEN We rejoice that women all over the world are experiencing God&#39;s special visitation. They are awakening to their birthright and inheritance as they trust God to fulfill all His purposes in and through them. They are learning to follow the leading of His Spirit, as they discover their intrinsic value, not in cultural, geographical and generational imperatives but rather in knowing that they are made in the image of God. The Creator, who designed both male and female to reflect His likeness and glory, calls men and women to serve together as equal partners in His purpose. We therefore covenant together to pursue reconciliation and justice extending not only to race and class but to gender also. As we men and women learn to walk and work together in mutual and godly respect, we are once again free to serve God&#39;s plan and purpose in terms of our own special contribution. (Jdg 4:4; Ru 1:16 - 17; 1 Sa 1:11; Joel 2:28 -29; Lk 2:36, 8:3; Jn 20:11-18; Ac 9:36; 16:13-14; 21:8; Ro 16:12) 16. EMERGING LEADERS Over the past 50 years, courageous young leaders have birthed many churches and mission agencies, that have sent tens of thousands of missionaries around the world. These leaders are now in their senior years. Some have graduated to glory. The mantle of authority is passing to a younger generation of leaders who are boldly rising to their responsibility. The unified voice of these emerging leaders overcomes barriers of nationality, language, culture, gender, denomination and theology. Through multiple channels of communication and interaction, a clear set of values and priorities has surfaced among these young leaders. They find their identity more in vision and calling, than in organizations. Intimacy with Christ coupled with praise and worship are core values. A deep longing for unity among the entire Body of Christ compels these young leaders to overcome denominational, and doctrinal differences within the evangelical tradition. They desire mentoring and input from mature leaders as they work in unity to complete the great commission. We, therefore, covenant together to support the emerging leaders, whom God has raised up, to encourage them in their dreams, and to make room for their gifts, ideas, and initiatives. (Da 3:16-18, 28; Joel 2:28; 1 Ti 4:12, 5:1; Tit 2:6; 1 Pe 5:5; 1 Jn 2:13, 14) 17. UNREACHED PEOPLES We praise God for the epic progress in researching, listing, and profiling unreached peoples. We rejoice that all the unreached people groups of over 10,000 persons have now been profiled and adopted. We appreciate deeply the responses by churches and agencies in mobilizing prayer, leading national initiatives, and commissioning teams to establish indigenous churches among many unreached peoples. As a result the number of peoples without a single indigenous congregation of 100 members is getting smaller and smaller. On one hand, we lament that the goal of a church for every people and the gospel for every person was not fully achieved by the year 2000. We regret, too, the minimal attention which has been given to children in our research and formulation of strategies for world evangelization. But on the other hand, we celebrate the accomplishments of the AD2000 &amp; Beyond Movement and commend this task to those who follow. We covenant together to press on towards its fulfillment.(Ge 22:18; Ps 72:17; Isa 19:25; 52:15; Ro 15:20; 2 Pe 3:9) 18. NATIONAL INITIATIVES We rejoice that, during the past decade, churches in many countries have developed national strategies and processes for mobilizing the Body of Christ toward completing the unfinished task within and beyond their borders. Visionary servant leaders have facilitated national initiatives that affirm existing structures and foster cooperative commitments to saturation church planting and to the goal of a pioneer church planting movement within every ethno-linguistic people. We praise God that, in this past decade, united efforts of His people have borne much fruit. And yet much work remains. Therefore, we pray for the hastening of the day when all persons will have a valid opportunity to experience the love, truth and saving power of Jesus in fellowship with other believers of their own people. We encourage God&#39;s people everywhere to do their part in establishing a mission-minded church planting movement within every unreached people. We covenant together to seek and discover God&#39;s role for each of us in His purpose, regardless of the cost. (2 Sa 24:24; Jnh 3:7-9; Ac 13:43-44; 18: 9-11; Ro 1:8, 10:18, 16:19; 2 Pe 3:9;1 Th 1:8; 1 Ti 2:4) 19. COMMUNITY TRANSFORMATION As we cross into the new millennium, we bear witness to the work of the Holy Spirit. In cities throughout the world spiritual breakthroughs are occurring. His presence and power are touching and transforming every sphere of human life-spiritual, political, economic and social - with visible, measurable change and multitudes coming to salvation in Christ. Focused, fervent, future-oriented, faith-filled, persevering prayer led by humble, likeminded persevering leaders who dare to believe God for the &quot;immeasurably more&quot; He has for the city are key for community transformation. Beginning with His church, God is shaking old structures and shaping new patterns of ministry to meet the challenges of a fast-changing world. Diagnostic research enables the Church to profile communities and discern needs. Spiritual action plans include bonding among the spiritual gatekeepers of the city through annual prayer summits, catalytic corporate prayer events; ongoing grassroots prayer involvement; servant evangelism through acts of kindness and social reconciliation. An infrastructure of prayer evangelism cells or small groups in homes, workplaces, schools, or campuses &quot;pastor&quot; the community. Public power encounters and citywide harvest events involve every willing individual and institution. Therefore, we covenant together to see our cities through the eyes of Christ and to serve our cities with the heart and humility of Christ. We will work together to repair our communities, restore the dignity of persons, to renew hope, revive spirits, and redeem lives in the power of Christ&#39;s love! (Ps 110:3; Isa 59:16; Eze 3:17; Dan. 10:12-14; 2 Co 4:4; Eph 3:20-21; Eph 6:12; Jas 5:16) 20. GLOBAL PARTNERSHIP We affirm that partnerships are an important part of world evangelization. We build relationships of trust so we can work together in partnership, to see fellowships of believers in Christ among all peoples that will worship Him. A fundamental question in mission must change from &#39;What can I do?&#39; to &#39;How do we fit in, in relationship to what others are doing?&#39; Partnerships can help us answer this question and provide a forum for practical collaboration. In the past two decades we have seen a new day dawn among God&#39;s people everywhere to worship and work together with God&#39;s people from everywhere. We rejoice in the many dozens of international partnerships emerging and operating among and for the good of the unreached peoples. We believe this effort is pleasing to God, true to His character and to the mission of the church. However, a major challenge is still before us. These partnerships will not emerge or operate without people who have the vision, skills and commitment to both the partnership purpose and process. We, therefore, covenant together to encourage the global Church to identify, recruit, train and support partnership facilitators. (Ex 17:12; Jdg 20:1;1 Sa14:6-7; 1 Ch 12:22-38; Ne 3:1-32; Mt 18:19-20; Lk 5:17-20; 1 Co 12:12, 20 - 27; Lk. 5:17-20; 3 Jn 8) At the conclusion of this historic event and in response to God&#39;s grace, we now recommit ourselves to the incarnate, crucified, resurrected, ascended, exalted and returning Messiah. We abandon ourselves unreservedly to Him and to His cause. In doing so, we know that we will risk incurring the wrath of a world that rejects us even as it rejected and crucified Him. Yet His Great Commission is not merely an option to be considered but a mandate to be obeyed. Therefore, in the light of His second coming, we covenant together, by God&#39;s enabling grace, to strive toward the goal of the whole Church taking the whole Gospel to the whole world. We will in this century aim to establish a reproducing church movement among every class and kind of people and within practical and relational reach of every person so that every segment of society will be permeated with the love, compassion, truth and saving power of Christ, the Messiah. May the whole earth be filled with the glory of the Triune God! The bride of Christ along with the Spirit, says to the One who is coming soon: Come! Amen. Come, Lord Jesus.(Ps 96:3; Mt 28:18-20; Jn 12:24, 13:34-35, 15:18 - 19; Ro 6:13, 12:1; 1 Co 6:19 - 20; 2 Co 5:20; Rev 22:20) Article source: http://www.ad2000.org/celebrate/manifesto.htm",

    "title": "AD2000 and Beyond Movement Overview",
    "content": "AD2000 and Beyond Movement Overview At the beginning of this decade, researchers reported that more than 2000 different evangelization plans by Christian organizations and denominations focused on the year 2000. The AD2000 &amp; Beyond Movement first gained attention at the international missions conference Lausanne II in Manila in 1989. The Movement then spread rapidly around the globe to help catalyze these evangelism plans that focus on the year 2000. The AD2000 &amp; Beyond Movement seeks to encourage cooperation in establishing a church within every unreached people group and making the gospel available to every person by the year 2000. Ralph Winter, founder of the U.S. Center for World Mission, calls the AD2000 &amp; Beyond Movement &quot;the largest, most pervasive global evangelical network ever to exist.&quot; Patrick Johnstone, author of the book Operation World, writes, &quot;I believe that God has given us the best opportunity in all history to gain a wide level of support among Christians committed to world evangelization in the AD2000 vision.&quot; The AD2000 &amp; Beyond Movement has spread the vision for reaching the &quot;10/40 Window,&quot; a region first identified by the Movement&#39;s International Director, Luis Bush. The 10/40 Window is the rectangular area of North Africa, the Middle East and Asia between 10 degrees north and 40 degrees north latitude where 95 percent of the world&#39;s least-evangelized poor are found. The AD2000 prayer initiatives called &quot;Praying Through the Window&quot; have mobilized over 30 million intercessors to pray for the 10/40 Window over several years. The leaders of the Movement neither predict nor prophesy &quot;closure&quot; by the year 2000. But they are calling the church to face realistically its commission to make disciples of all peoples and to pursue that priority with greater zeal and unity than ever before. The role of the AD2000 Movement may be capsulized in three C&#39;s: Catalyst. The AD2000 &amp; Beyond Movement is a mobilizing entity which endeavors to bring together existing churches, movements and structures in the common goals of evangelism and church planting. Coordinator. The AD2000 &amp; Beyond Movement facilitates cooperative mission efforts while functioning in a coordinating role. Communicator. The AD2000 &amp; Beyond Movement provides a crucial communications link between Christian leaders from every region of the world and from many elements within the body of Christ. The structure of the AD2000 &amp; Beyond Movement has four features which give it strength and vitality: It is a grassroots movement. The Movement does not function from the top down, but from the bottom up. Although the movement has strong leadership, those leaders recognize their role as primarily one of encouragement and facilitation, providing assistance to national, regional and resource network leaders worldwide. It serves the whole Body of Christ. The Movement brings together the entire spectrum of the contemporary Protestant church, particularly removing the barriers between traditional Evangelicals, Pentecostals and Charismatics. It is led by non-Westerners. Four of the key leaders of the AD2000 &amp; Beyond Movement are: Luis Bush, International Director, from Argentina; Thomas Wang, Chairman, from Mainland China; John Richard, Associate International Director for Special Projects, from India; and Joon-Gon Kim, Chairman of the GCOWE Preparation Committee, from Korea. It seeks to avoid duplication of efforts. The Movement seeks to get missionaries communicating with one another, evidenced in Mali, Africa at a Bible translation meeting triggered by the AD2000 &amp; Beyond Movement. Three groups discovered they had each been working on the same new Bible translation unaware of the other groups&#39; efforts. Now these same organizations are working together to complete the project three times faster. The AD2000 &amp; Beyond Movement sponsored the May 17-25, 1995 Global Consultation on World Evangelization (GCOWE &#39;95). Nearly 4,000 Christian leaders representing 186 countries gathered to formulate evangelism plans focusing on the year 2000. GCOWE &#39;95 probably was attended by people from more countries than any other Christian gathering in the history of the world. More countries were represented than even the 1988 Olympic games, also held in Seoul, which attracted athletes from 160 countries. GCOWE &#39;95 was a rite of passage for the missionary-sending movements from Asia, Africa and Latin America. For example, three-quarters of the consultation&#39;s financing and two-thirds of the delegates were from the non-Western world. A powerful demonstration of a new missionary force took place at the Seoul Olympic Stadium where the consultation delegates joined 70,000 Korean Christian youth of whom 60,000 dedicated themselves in writing to bring about global evangelization in their generation. For the remaining years of the millennium, the AD2000 &amp; Beyond Movement launched Joshua Project 2000 and National AD2000 Initiatives Joshua Project 2000 is a global cooperative strategy which has identified 1,739 peoples most needing a church-planting effort. Joshua Project 2000 is bringing together workers to research these peoples, produce prayer profiles, enlist prayer teams and mobilize church-planting teams. The goal of Joshua Project 2000 is to make a priority of establishing, as a minimum, a pioneer church-planting movement within every ethno-linguistic people of over 10,000 individuals by December 31, 2000. National AD2000 Initiatives are the best expressions of the practical outworking of the AD2000 &amp; Beyond Movement. As of 1999, most countries of the world have some kind of National AD2000 Initiative. The aim of these initiatives is to see the body of Christ in every nation mobilized and working in coordinated efforts toward the completion of the unfinished task of evangelization in their own country, making a significant contribution to evangelism and church planting in the least evangelized peoples and countries of the world by the year AD2000 and beyond. The two predominant measurable goals of the National AD2000 Initiatives are: 1) To see as a priority and minimum, a pioneer church planting movement within every major ethno-linguistic people in the nation, country and mega-city of the world by the end of the year 2000 and, 2) To see the establishment of a saturation church planting project in each and every nation also by the end of the millennium. The building blocks are resource networks and task forces into which additional energies and focus resources are channeled. Each one is semi-autonomous and bears its own responsibility for developing organization structures, emphases, goals, strategies, consultations, publications, funding and personnel. Resource network, task force and national leaders work together, coordinating joint projects. Over the next two years, many mobilization events are being planned by the AD2000 &amp; Beyond Movement. Two of these are listed below: Celebrate Messiah 2000 27 Dec. 2000-2 Jan. 2001: An historic event to a) exalt Jesus Christ, b) cultivate a spirit of reconciliation, c) transfer Christian leadership to a new generation, d) seek the Lord together to understand what the Holy Spirit is saying to the church for the next century, e) help prepare the Body of Christ for the challenges of the coming century.

    "content": "The Arabian Peninsula: An Opening at the Heart of the 10/40 Window Luis Bush International Director AD2000 &amp; Beyond Movement Talal grew up in a nation on the Arabian Peninsula. He came to faith through a dream, but as a new Christian he was unable to obtain a Bible or even meet another Christian. Soon after Talal became a Christian he went to study in another Arab country. There he decided to pursue his new faith actively. He went to an Evangelical church, was baptized and joined their youth group. He was warmly welcomed into the church family, and attended the youth meetings for nearly three years. One of the church elders, an experienced Christian worker, discipled Talal and he returned to the Arabian Peninsula as a mature Christian. After his return Talal began to share his new faith, and his brother accepted Christ, Encouraged, he continued to share with others in the family. Then one of his cousins threatened to kill him and forced him to recite the Islamic creed and denounce his faith. Not knowing where to turn, he agreed and his cousin let him go. See I am dong a new thing Now it springs up Do you not perceive it? I am making a way in the desert and streams in the wasteland. After four years of searching for fellowship, Talal finally was able to make contact with us. He is still sharing his faith, but more quietly now. He and his brother have not had any fellowship in these four years. Talal feels guilty because he denied Christ We have tried to help and encourage him. Recently he said to me, &quot;You live in a different world. For you being a Christian is easy; for me, it is hard!&quot; Talal&#39;s story is typical for the Arabian Peninsula. He faces fear; accusation, family pressures, lock of fellowship and many more challenges as he strives to grow in his faith. However, in some areas there already is an indigenous local church. Small pockets of believers meet together in homes. In some instances entire families have come to Christ. Though the Arabian Peninsula is often misunderstood, it presents a picture of great need and great opportunity today. Can you hear the Arabian Peninsula calling, &quot;Come and help us&quot; (Acts 16;2)? As I have visited most of the countries in the Arabian Peninsula and met with Christians throughout the region, it has become very clear to me that this is the hour of spiritual opportunity. This brochure will tell you why.. and how you can have a vital part in a great spiritual awakening in the very heart of the Middle East. U.A.E. The United Arab Emirates (UAE) is a confederation of seven kingdoms, or emirates, on the north-eastern coast of the Arabian Peninsula. They are linked by their dependance on oil revenues, which have brought them from poverty to prosperity in only 25 years. The UAE was formerly seven separate monarchies protected by the United Kingdom, but the emirates united as a confederation in 1971. Sunni Islam is the state religion, but religious minorities have freedom of worship. Is the Middle East - and specifically the Arabian Peninsula - truly reachable? Most western Christians believe it is not. But after you read this article I hope you will agree with an increasing number of Arab nationals and internationals who respond to that question with a resounding &quot;Yes!&quot; Stereotypes abound in the Middle East, especially negative stereotypes about Arab people. It is an area of striking contradictions and conflicts: excessive wealth and abject poverty; ancient Christian centers in the heart of the Muslim world; the old in conflict with the new; western political ideologies and materialism in conflict with east em culture; a society in which passion mingles with tolerance. Twenty-one Arabic-speaking countries are spread across North Africa, the Central Middle East and the Arabian Peninsula. Together they have a population at some 270 million people, and that number is growing by half a million every month. Seven of those countries are in the Arabian Peninsula: Bahrain, Kuwait Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and Yemen. These nations are the focus of this brochure. The heart of the 10/40 window - The core of the world&#39;s unreached people live in a window that extends from West Africa to East Asia, from ten degrees north to forty degrees north of the equator. This region, called &quot;The 10/40 Window,&quot; encompasses nearly three billion people, including most of the world&#39;s Muslims, Hindus, and Buddhists. The Arabian Peninsula lies at the very heart of the 10/40 Window. No region of the world has been so resistant to the Gospel of Jesus Christ. The Peninsula is the core of Islam. The two holiest cities in the Islamic world - Mecca and Medina - are in Saudi Arabia, the largest nation on the Peninsula. There are over one billion - ie. 22% of the world&#39;s population - Muslims in the world. Each is required to pray toward the city of Mecca five times every day. Each year more than two million of them make the Hajj, or pilgrimage, to Mecca. A massive Islamic missionary effort is coordinated by the Muslim World League in Mecca. Vast sums of money are used to propagate Islam around the world: aid to countries considered sympathetic, building mosques, sending missionaries, literature, radio, etc. The world&#39;s largest printing presses are located here, and they churn out 28 million copies of the Koran every year for worldwide distribution. It we are serious in our commitment to provide a valid opportunity for every person to experience the truth and saving power of Jesus Christ, we cannot ignore the compelling realities of the Arabian Peninsula. The heart of God for the people of the Peninsula - Many Christians think of the Old Testament as the story of God&#39;s dealing with Israel, His chosen people. But from Creation to Abraham, there was no unique &quot;People of God.&quot; Throughout this vast expanse of time, God was dealing with &quot;the nations&quot; (Gen. 111). That included the ancestors of today&#39;s Arabs, the people of the Arabian Peninsula. When God called Abraham, a man who lived in a pagan culture, He promised that through Abraham &quot;all notions&quot; would be blessed (Gen. 12:3). Solomon, following God&#39;s instructions, built his Temple for &quot;all nations&quot; (2 Chr 6:32-33). Isaiah, representing the Old Testament prophets, reaffirms God&#39;s desire that &quot;all nations&quot; should turn to Him (isa. 49:6, 56:1,3). In the New Testament, Christ&#39;s parting charge to His disciples was that they should carry the Good News of His love to all people everywhere. That Great Commission certainly included - and includes today - the neighbors to the east of Palestine.. the people of the Arabian Peninsula. Strategic Urban Centers by Country &nbsp; Bahrain Manamah Kuwait Kuwait City Oman Muscat Nizwa Salalah Qatar Doha Saudi Arabia Qasiim Najran Dammam Ha&#39;il Medina Mecca Jeddah Tabuk Riradh Khamis Mushayt U.A.E. Dubai Abu Dhabi Al Ain Sharjah Yemen Aden Sana&#39;a Hudaydah Taiz Mukalla Hadramawt Region Saadah The Arabian Peninsula is accessible - &quot;He turned the desert into pools of water and the parched ground into flowing springs&quot; (Ps. 107:35). The growing flow of internationals into the Arabian Peninsula (see chart) brings labor and expertise for building the nations&#39; infrastructure and providing needed services. It also brings many Christians to the region. More than seven of every ten residents in Qatar and Bahrain are expatriates. There are at least 420,000 expatriate Christians in the entire Peninsula. Yemen Yemen occupies the southern tip of the Arabian Peninsula. The varied topography includes hot costal plains, cool mountains and scorching deserts. Yemen&#39;s economy is agricultural and pastoral, with increasing export of oil. Until 1990, the widely differing North and South were separate nations. Unification brought ideological and even military clashes between the more fundamentalist North and more liberal South. Islam is the state religion, yet the North and South disagree as to the status of religious freedom; the North favors Islamic fundamentalism and the South wants a more moderate stance. Global prayer focus on the Arabian Peninsula is increasing dramatically - Christians within the Peninsula comment: &quot;We have seen great gains in the last five years in this part of the Middle East. More people are praying for this part of the world than ever before in history! That gives us confidence, and a spiritual mandate to enter and be fruitful in the land. With this kind of heavenly prayer cover we know the Arabs who we care about so much will have a chance to hear. Your prayers continue with our servants on the ground led by the Holy Spirit to set the people free!&quot; Growing interest in the 10/40 Window is focusing prayer for a spiritual breakthrough in the Arab world. In the October 1993 &quot;Praying through the Window&quot; emphasis, more than 1,200 local churches and some 21 million Christians adopted one of the Arab countries - many of them in the Arabian Peninsula for special prayer. On-site intercessory teams came to each of the countries for days of prayer and fasting, asking God for a spiritual breakthrough. In 1995 there was a further global prayer focus on the megacities of the 10/40 Window. An estimated 36 million Christians participated in that effort. Millions prayed for the megacities of the Arabian Peninsula. In 1997 global prayer was focused on the peoples of the Arabian Peninsula. During &quot;MPraying through the Window IV&quot; (October 1999) millions of Christians worldwide are expected to pray specifically far the Arabian Peninsula, with a special focus on the strategic towns. The Historical Significance of the Arabian Peninsula The History of the People of the Arabian Peninsula begins in Genesis 10 where the beginnings of nations are described. The bulk of the population of Arabia are descendants of Shem (ie. Semitic peoples - the Hebrews, Arabs, Arameans). There were two primary peoples who inhabited Arabia. One was largely nomadic, wandering with their flocks over the great deserts, which lie, between the river Euphrates and the center of the peninsula. The other group was the inhabitants of the rain-fed uplands of Yemen. Camels were domesticated in Arabia between 1500-1200BC. The Arabs were the nomadic peoples of the central northern part of Arabia. The word itself is probably derived from a Semitic root related to nomadism. It was the Romans who used the term Arabia to cover the whole of the peninsula. It was with these nomadic peoples that Ishmael and his twelve sons - together with the children of Esau - joined. There are still Bedoum tribes in Northern Arabia named after two of the sons of Ishmael. Bahrain Bahrain consists of a group of islands located in the Arabian Gulf northeast of the Arabian Peninsula. A causeway links the largest island (also known as Bahrain) to mainland Saudi Arabia. The islands are flat and hot, mainly sand covered limestone; with generally poor and infertile soil. The southern peoples of Arabia are also basically Semitic peoples, descendants of Joktan and Cush. The source of their wealth in earlier times was their position on trade routes from India, East Africa, South East Asia and China, as well as their supplies of frankincense. Later in the 4th century BC, Himyaritic peoples from the Horn of Africa dominated the area. Navigation of the Red Sea was difficult and dangerous owing to coral reefs and pirates. Most of the goods traded were carried by camel from South Yemen up to the Mediterranean Sea. This lucrative trade produced a wealthy and civilized community in Yemen. The Queen of Sheba, who paid a very famous visit to Solomon, was a Queen of Yemen. Halfway between Yemen and the Mediterranean cultures lies a small desert settlement called Mecca. Mecca was a staging past for this caravan trade. Judaism, and to a lesser extent Christianity, had penetrated into the area by the 6th century AD. But most of the peoples of northern Arabia were worshippers of spirits. They made pilgrimages to sacred stones. These places were thought to be residences of spirits, jinn or afrit. Slowly monotheism was beginning to be increasingly accepted.

They reviewed the present realities and current trends of their region, dreaming/visualizing by faith where God would want the church to be by December 31, 2000. They summarized their vision for the Arabian Peninsula this way: Key verses: Isaiah 42:8-12 &#39;I am the LORD; that is my name! I will not give my glory to another or my praise to idols. See, the former things have taken place, and new things I declare: before they spring into being I announce them to you. Sing to the LORD a new song, his praise from the ends of the earth, you who go down to the sea, and all that is in it, you islands, and all who live in them. Let the desert and its towns raise their voices; let the settlements where Kedar lives rejoice. Let the people of Sela sing for jog; let them shout from the mountaintops. Let them give glory to the LORD and proclaim his praise in the islands.&quot; Mission Statement: Our Mission as a body of believers in this country is to live a holy life of prayer, dedication and love before God, in order to encourage our brothers and sisters and to love and reach the unreached people among whom we live. Evangelistic Outreach: A church planting movement for every people and major tribe in the Peninsula. The gospel available to every person in the Peninsula. A church united and zealous for reaching the unreached both in and outside the Peninsula. (&quot;My dream is that the Christians in the Peninsula will love the people of the Peninsula)&quot; &quot;My dream is to see a church started for every tribe.&quot; &quot;My dream is to see people reach out to every village.&quot;) Cities: A regular gathering of church leaders in each of the major cities, and an outreach to each of the major people groups overseen by a united church in each of the main cities. God&#39;s Word and Literature: The Bible available in the language of every person. (&quot;My dream is that the Lord will extend to the Arabian Peninsula a special measure of grace and mercy to receive a Gospel message without resistance or deception of Satan.&quot; &quot;My dream is that every mall will have a bookstore selling Bibles.&quot;) Mobilization of Women: We seek to mobilize and equip women who will target each of the above-mentioned unreached people groups. (&quot;My dream is that the women of the Arabian Peninsula have liberty in Christ.&quot;) Kuwait Kuwait is wedged in the desert between Iraq and Saudi Arabia, at the northwest end of the Arabian Gulf. There are no rivers and rain is light. In the quest for drinking water, the world&#39;s largest desalination plants were built in Kuwait in 1950. A former British protectorate, Kuwait gained independence in 1961, and since 1992 an Emir has controlled cabinet in the newly re-established parliament. Sunni Islam is the state religion. Immigrant religious minorities are permitted some worship facilities. Expatriate Christians gained recognition for their prayer and relief aid during and after the 1990 Iraqi occupation. Frustrating restrictions imposed on Christian gatherings have since been eased. Populations Local vs Foreign by Country CountryTotal Pop.Locals% LocalsExpatriates% Expat.

Also, because it is a place where there are tribes who have never heard and we need to tell them in order to &#39;hasten the Day&#39; that Jesus can come back (2 Peter 3:12 and Matt. 24:14). A new spirit of unity is growing in the region, laying the foundation for even greater partnership. An Arab national Christian has said, &quot;We have thought less than even one half of what God is about to do here.&quot; Oman The Sultanate of Oman is a mountainous land on the southeast coast of the Arabian Peninsula. It controls the Hormuz Straits, entrance to the Arabian Gulf. The wise distribution of Oman&#39;s wealth has improved the standard of living. Oman was a feudal monarchy until 1970, when it became an absolute monarchy. No political parties are permitted, but there is considerable personal freedom and political stability. Islam is the state religion, and the entire Muslim majority remains largely unreached with the Gospel. Oil wealth, rising education levels, and opening to the outside world have broadened the minds of Omanis, possibly making them more receptive to spiritual change. It is time for God&#39;s people around the world to get involved. National Christian initiatives are growing. The ground has been prepared through careful study. Cooperation and partnership are increasing. Intensive global prayer is increasingly focusing on the Arab world. A respected international working in the area has said that he expects a spiritual harvest in the Arab world in the near future &quot;because of growing awareness and prayers of the saints around the world.&quot; Expectations of nationals and expatriates is growing. On long-term Christian worker in the area summarized it this way: &quot;We are in the generation in which the Arab world will see a dramatic spiritual breakthrough.&quot; An Arab historian/theologian told me: &quot;I believe an outpouring of God&#39;s Spirit is coming soon to the church in the Arab world. I have been a student of church history for many years. Every other region has experienced revival except ours! Now it&#39;s our turn.&quot; So be it, Lord! What can you do?

Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabia is an Islamic kingdom occupying most of the Arabian Peninsula. Saudi Arabia is almost entirely desert but contains 25% of the world&#39;s known oil reserves. The nation is ruled by an absolute monarchy, with the semi-feudal state tightly controlled by the large royal family.

    "content": "The Setting for Celebrate Messiah 2000 A Church for every people and the gospel for every person in the Holy Land establishes an appropriate setting for Celebrate Messiah 2000. Luis bush International Director, AD2000 Today is the 22nd of February. The Jerusalem Post headline reads &quot;Amman-Saddam meeting today.&quot; The article reported from Baghdad reads: &quot;UN Secretary General Kofi-Anna is scheduled to meet later today with Iraqi President Saddam Hussein in what is widely seen as a last-minute effort to avert a US-led attack aimed at forcing Baghdad to comply with UN resolutions.&quot; The title of the other major article reads: &quot;Government &#39;regretful&#39; as US, Canada urge citizens to leave.&quot; These are tumultuous times in the Holy Lands and the Middle East. Yet God is on the move in many ways in the midst of the turmoil. I have known veteran missionary, Ray Register, for years. Ray has documented the extraordinary advance of church planting efforts in the Holy Land, both in Israel and the Arab territories. Despite overwhelming obstacles of many kinds, and highly complex issues for the church planting effort, the last twenty years have been years of remarkable responsiveness and spiritual advance in these ancient lands. In the last five years, a minimum of 200 Arab Muslims have become believers and now assemble in mobile congregations. The number of Messianic Jewish house churches and congregations have multiplied from less than ten, twenty-five years ago, to eighty today. So shall my word be that goes forth from my mouth; it shall not return to me empty, but it shall accomplish that which I purpose, and prosper in the thing for which I sent it.Isaiah 55:11 Ray Register carefully describes his experiences and perspectives gleaned during the past thirty years, in a book titled, Back to Jerusalem, written to guide those who pray for the Middle East, and orient those called to serve there. Jerusalem has returned to center stage, not just of world politics, but center stage of God&#39;s activity in planting his Church anew in the Holy Land. Is it by chance that, as Jerusalem celebrates 3000 years of history, it also experiences almost phenomenal church growth? Back to Jerusalem needs to be published and Ray is looking for an appropriate publisher. (Please pray about a publisher; and recommend any you think may be interested, to Ray Register 104276.1403@Compuserve.com.)&lt;&gt; Today, Christian leaders are arriving from around the world for the Second Annual International Coordinating Committee meeting for Celebrate Messiah 2000 in the Holy Lands. This global event at the end of the millennium may well be one of the most significant gatherings ever held, and held in the year that holds the greatest promise and held in the place that has the greatest significance. My thesis in this brief report is that there is a direct link between the evident activity of God in planting His church anew in the Holy Land and the event, Celebrate Messiah 2000, in the Holy Lands. Believers, and fellowships of believers, both from Jewish and Moslem backgrounds, are suffering persecution today in the Holy Land. They need your prayers at this time. If you wish to know more about this confidential information, please contact me personally at 75210.1624@compuserve.com In this report, I have drawn key excerpts from the book, Back to Jerusalem, that reflect a picture of the Holy Spirit on the move in the Holy Land in the face of overwhelming obstacles and complex issues. One of the obstacles became very apparent to my wife, Doris, my son, Daniel, and I just yesterday afternoon as we visited with Ilan Zamir, son-in-law of Ray Register, in the hospital. Ilan serves as the President of King of King College, an organization that trains and plants teachers and congregation leaders in Israel. In addition, he serves as the President of the Messianic Jewish Alliance. He has been a vital reconciliatory embodiment of Christ&#39;s love, in bridging the relationship between Messianic Jews and Arabic Christians in the region. In July, Ilan spoke at a gathering of Arab pastors from the Holy Lands on the Mount of Olives. My wife, Doris, and I were privileged to observe as he was used mightily of God. Ilan has been a chairman of the Celebrate Messiah 2000 in the Holy Lands Host Committee, providing the international coordinating committee with insight and perspective for more than a year. I had just asked him to consider becoming chairman of the program committee for Celebrate Messiah 2000 in the Holy Lands. But it was only a matter of a few weeks when I received a report that Ilan had been operated on for a growth in his neck area resulting from familial Mediterranean fever, a rare disease. Upon returning to his home, he got extremely cold with severe back pain, and was rushed back to the hospital by his wife, Cheryl. The first diagnosis was spinal meningitis. This led to five unnecessary spinal taps, which led to blood clots and emergency spinal surgery. Ilan hovered close to death several times and his legs became paralyzed. Now, several months later, Ilan is still in the hospital, slowly recovering the use of his legs. As this battle for the life of one of the major human protagonists in the Holy Lands has raged with great intensity, so has the spiritual battle for the establishment of the Church in the Holy Lands. But in both cases, our God has done great and mighty things. Ilan shared with me that throughout the depths of his hellish experience of these many weeks, his walk with God grew in reality and intimacy. This report also speaks to the greatness of our God in overcoming huge obstacles toward the vision of &quot;a church for every people and the gospel for every person&quot; in the Holy Lands. I. A new responsiveness to the message of the gospel has been accompanied by a significant church planting effort. World attention remains focused on the Middle East as Israel and the Arab countries negotiate peace settlements. The &quot;Holy Land&quot; or present Israel-Palestine continues at center-stage of world attention as we race into the twenty-first century. Television brings the struggle and agony of Jew and Arab over their claims for the Holy sites in Hebron, Nablus and Jerusalem into our living rooms. But an even more dramatic and exciting observation captures the attention of Christian believers: Receptivity to the Gospel message of the saving power of God in Jesus Christ has increased in the aftermath of the Gulf War. Islam, though a formidable opponent to the Gospel, weakened in its monolithic control over the masses, as Muslim fought Muslim. The Muslim fundamentalist renewal reveals the heart-cry of the Middle Easterner for a deeper relationship with God and a hunger for spirituality. Evangelical Christians, from numerous churches and organizations, mounted a concerted effort of &quot;Praying through the 10/40 Window&quot; in October of 1993 to pray for all peoples living between 10° and 40° North Latitude, which included the majority of the Muslim world population. &quot;AD 2000 and Beyond&quot; became the theme of planning and preparation to reap the harvest resulting from concerted prayer. Israel, The Palestinian Authority, Jordan and other Middle East countries felt the impact of these prayers. For the first time in recent memory, Muslims began to accept the Gospel and the power of the written Word. They sought fellowship with Christians to learn how to pray and to worship God in new ways. Paralleling this new phenomenon, Jewish Messianic fellowships matured and opened their doors to Muslim believers. Christian Arabs began, for the first time, to see the ripe harvest field surrounding them. They lost their fear of witnessing to both Muslims and Jews. Persecution and opposition have resulted, and many suffer for their faith. Muslim, Jewish, and Christian believers survive and their fellowships grow by pulling together. A recent survey, conducted in 1997, found about 160 congregations and house groups scattered throughout the Holy Land, an increase of 35% in the number of congregations in just four years! Those fielding the survey indicate that the number of congregations grew by 33 1/3% in this past year alone-almost half of these in cities and villages that were formed this past year. There are now congregations or home groups in thirty-five of the fifty largest cities. These figures include fifty Arab Christian congregations and home groups, and eighty Jewish congregations and home groups. That means there are at least 30 international congregations and home groups. The group making the directory of congregations in the cities and villages of the Holy Land are calling for concerted prayer during this &quot;Year of Jubilee&quot; for congregations and home fellowships to start in all of the fifty largest cities. The good news that Jesus saves, and reconciles men to God and to each other, spread from Jerusalem in the first century like wildfire, flamed by the wind of the Holy Spirit. The fire went underground and smoldered in the traditional churches that dot the landscape of the Holy City with the Islamic invasion of the seventh century. Now, with the dawning of the twenty-first century, the fire is breaking out again, fanned by the praise of numerous believers of all nationalities in assemblies, house churches and traditional churches all over Jerusalem. This new responsiveness in the Holy Land and the Middle East requires new strategies for Gospel ministries for the twenty-first century. This book maintains that God plants churches in the Holy Land when his servants, both local and expatriate, incarnate the love of Christ in culturally-sensitive witness, humble service, sacrificial sharing, fervent prayer, and brotherly love. A time of harvest follows patient rock-removal, diligent soil preparation, generous sowing, and God&#39;s provision of the rain of the Holy Spirit in due season. God proved this to us over and over again during thirty years of labor in the Holy Land. II. Overwhelming obstacles face those engaged in advancing the gospel in the Holy Lands: Separating the present from the past Complex forces and attitudes challenge the church planter in the Middle East today. The present is bound by the past. Every place you put down a shovel or plow and kick up dust and rocks in the Holy Land, you may find an artifact dating from 100 to 3000 years ago. Separating the present from the past is a venture in futility. The people you meet are bound with the past. The past may be your best guide if you plan to venture into the Holy Land to share new ideas, especially about religion or your relationship with God. It helps you understand people&#39;s present positions and attitudes. This is not to deny that a straightforward presentation of the Gospel can produce instant response, even in the Holy Land. The Word of God is still &quot;living and active and sharper than any two-edged sword.&quot; You will face local reactions and attitudes when you share the good news of Jesus on long-term basis and plant churches in this rocky soil. These reactions may be based, at least in the beginning, on past stereotypes, prejudices and cultural norms. They condition the spoken and unspoken responses to our presentation of the Gospel. They can make your work more difficult, or they can be turned to your advantage. God will use your witness to draw people to his anointed one, Jesus, who said, &quot;I, if I be lifted up, will draw all men unto myself.&quot; The historical churches The Greek Orthodox Church, descendant of the Byzantines, considers itself the successor to the apostles and the church of the land. Centuries of living as dhimmi, or subjugated people, under Muslim domination in religious communities, or millets, caused them to turn inward. Their traditions enshrined in the holy places, the priesthood, and sacred worship, provide them with a tenacious capacity for preservation in a sometimes hostile environment. &quot;Orthodoxy&quot; refers to their feeling that they alone believe and practice the true Christian faith. They may look at expatriates, persons living in the Holy Land who are not citizens of the Holy Land, and others who come with teachings of personal salvation and the priesthood of the believer, as heretical. They are a threat to the &quot;status quo&quot; that salvation is through the covenant community, and the priest is the mediator of divine grace through the sacraments. Anti-Christian sentiment in the Holy Land There is prejudice and anti-Christian polemic in the Holy Land today. Anti-mission groups earn their salaries by continuing to stir the fire under the cauldron of prejudice. They try to make the lives of Christian workers unbearable and actively campaign against their presence in the Holy Land. But the number of Messianic believers in Jesus continues to increase. The Israeli public becomes more informed about the real faith and life of evangelical Christians, making the work of the detractors more difficult. The title &quot;missionary&quot; is a bad word in Israel. The Israeli public is taught that a missionary is a subversive who bribes people to change their religion. A so-called &quot;anti-mission law&quot; was passed years ago in an attempt to discourage missionary activity. It was basically an anti-bribery law that never stuck against Christians, since they also abhor bribery as an enticement to conversion. It is ironic that messianic Jews who believe in Jesus as Messiah are now called &quot;missionaries&quot; as a method of slander or derision. The secular Israeli public recognizes that a greater threat to Israeli society is extreme Orthodox Judaism, which tries to squeeze the country in its mold and restrict religious freedom. You still can feel the hostility at times engendered by centuries of polemic and persecution by Christians against Jews. The situation is reversed in Israel. The Jews are in the majority and Christians are now a minority within a minority. It requires a great deal of patience and humility. God himself is intervening. Jews from all walks of life and all nationalities are coming to believe that Jesus is the Messiah of Israel. Many resemble, in their experiences and personalities, the original disciples of Jesus. His Church is coming &quot;back to Jerusalem.&quot; Fanatical Islam Ayatollah Khomeini fanned the flames of Islamic renewal with an audio-cassette-tape-inspired revolution in Iran. Saudi Arabia, fearing Khomeini&#39;s Shiite form of Islam, began flooding the Middle East with oil money to build mosques and encourage a return to fundamentalist orthodox, or Sunni, Islam. Mosques began springing up in remote Arab villages all over Galilee and the West Bank. Men grew their beards and women dressed in conservative garb. Young Muslims, who formerly rebelled against their parent&#39;s religion, began flocking to the mosques for prayer. Islamic universities sprang up in Israel, the West Bank and Gaza. I asked a Muslim friend who was formerly non-religious, &quot;Why did you return to Islam?&quot; He told me, &quot;I tried money. I tried sex. I tried Communism. Nothing satisfied the emptiness in my heart. So I knew I needed to return to Islam!&quot; Many return to fundamentalist Islam in search for meaning in life. They feel the root cause of the pitiful state of the Arabs in the Middle East is because they have strayed from the truths of Islam. &quot;Islam is the alternative!&quot;, is the slogan appealing to many seeking identity and victory over life&#39;s adversities. Islamic organizations have sprung up in Arab villages to deal with social, health and educational needs that the Jewish government neglected or underfunded. Islamic parties won major victories over the Communists in municipal elections. The Arab Muslims regained their pride. Unfortunately all the gains were not positive. Muslims, who were long-term friends with Christian neighbors, shunned them after returning from the Hajj, the pilgrimage to Mecca. Some mosques in the West Bank and Gaza became training grounds for radical militant activity and inflammatory Friday sermons against the occupation authorities and the Israeli public. The chilling result was a series of bus bombings and other terrorist acts designed to stall the Israeli-Palestinian peace process. Rigid Monotheism Islam inherited the rigid numerical understanding of &quot;God is one&quot; from Judaism. Rigid monotheism conditions Jews and Muslims to resist the idea of the incarnation of Christ. Judaism accepted the triune nature of God until the Christians adapted the concept to explain Jesus&#39; relation to God the Father and to the Holy Spirit. The unity of God is an underlying theme of Jesus&#39; and Paul&#39;s teachings. To claim that Christians blaspheme in their belief in the Trinity is a distortion of the teachings of the New Testament. Present-day Judaism denies the virgin birth and rejects the resurrection. Islam accepts the virgin birth and denies the cross, despite the fact that the Quran teaches that Jesus died. Muhammad, unfortunately, received the impression from the Christians of his day that the Trinity consisted of God, Mary and Jesus. Neither Judaism nor Islam provide their followers with the certainty of forgiveness of sins. They offer no personal relationship with God as Father. Nor do they provide the certainty of salvation and eternal life. The trinitarian concept of God can be said to originate in the Old Testament through the use of names for God such as Elohim, which in Hebrew means a plurality of the Godhead and is a term of majesty or respect. It is also indicated in the theophany or appearance of the Lord as three Angels to Abraham at Mamre in Genesis 18. The Christian understanding of God as Father, Son, and Holy Spirit issues from the New Testament record and is confirmed by personal experience. Once person experiences the reality of the living God, revealed through the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus, through the power of the Holy Spirit, all arguments vanish. Spiritual life begins for both the Jew and the Muslim when Jesus is experienced for who He is. Inherited Religion Religion in the Middle East is a matter of inheritance, more than a conviction of conscience. A person is born into his religion and is expected to die in his religion. Religion is a matter of personal status received at birth. Your nationality, in your identity card, is your religion. The Middle Easterner sees religion as a matter of birth, whereas westerners understand it as a matter of personal choice. You are born a Christian, a Jew, or a Muslim, and your baptism or your circumcision marks you for life. It determines your nationality, your marriage, often your occupation, your inheritance and your burial. Changing one&#39;s religion in the Middle East is tantamount to betraying your family, your culture and your country. It is looked upon as a denial of your heritage. To leave your religion is to leave your family, community and nation. Strict Jews can be severe in their reaction to those in their families who come to believe in Jesus, whereas secular Jews may be somewhat more accepting. Muslims who receive Jesus as Savior can be severely persecuted and may even be killed, if not protected. Some choose to remain as &quot;secret believers&quot; in such an environment, in hopes that they may influence their families and friends to also receive their faith in Jesus. Then they can move in numbers to preserve community and to protect each other. Groups of believing students or professionals form and provide protection for one another. I counsel believers to understand their families&#39; reactions and to deal with them in love and patience. Unfortunately, unwise and rash actions on the part of believers cause negative reactions from parents and relatives. Many, who use wisdom and patience, find opportunities to share their witness and to influence others to join them in the faith in Jesus. III. Crucial issues challenge church planting efforts and the advance of the gospel in the Holy Land Minority status Jews and Christians lived for centuries in the Muslim-controlled Middle East and Holy land as minorities, or dhimmi. These were gathered into religious communities, or millets. To this day, each religious group lives in its separate quarter in the Old City of Jerusalem. Previous to the Muslim conquest of the area, the Jew lived as a minority under the Byzantine and Roman governments. The present day Jewish aversion to change of religion, or conversion, may be, in part, due to a mechanism of protection, developed as a minority, so as not to offend the ruling power. The Romans were willing to leave the Jews and the Christians (or Messianic Jews) alone, as long as they did not rebel against Rome or take away loyal pagan citizens from the practices required by the Roman emperors. Part of the motivation of Caiphas, the high priest, in plotting to turn Jesus over to the Romans, was so &quot;the whole nation should not perish.&quot; The dhimmi status allows a great deal of freedom, as long as one stays in his birth community. A Jew can practice New Age, yoga, Buddhism, the occult, and almost any exotic form of divergence within Judaism and still be considered a Jew in the Holy Land. But if he or she accepts that Jesus is the true Messiah of Israel and decides to follow him, it is a step over the line, and considered a departure from Judaism. The Muslim does not adapt emotionally to minority status in the Holy Land. From the perspective of the Quran, the Muslims are the &quot;best of nations&quot; and should be in charge. They are quickly becoming a formidable political force inside Israel through natural birth rate, which is about twice as fast as that of the Jewish population. Evangelical Christians find themselves as the minority among the Arab minority in the Holy Land. Amazingly, Jews, who were the persecuted around the world and through the ages, find themselves in danger of being the persecutors. Many secular Jews, and some Orthodox, are conscious of this danger and seek to engage Christians in dialogue. The Directory of Organizations and Institutions of the Interreligious Coordinating Council in Israel lists 60 organizations dedicated wholly or in part to interfaith dialogue. Minority status is not a deterrent or a threat to those who know the living God through Jesus Christ. They can be the &quot;salt of the earth&quot; and the &quot;light of the world.&quot; Believers are letting their witness be felt in the Holy Land today and others are taking note. Religion and politics Religion and politics remain inseparable in the Holy Land. This reality requires a difficult adjustment for evangelical Christian workers who come from countries that cherish freedom of religion. Separation of church and state and religious freedom are built into the Constitution and Bill of Rights in the United States. Now we find ourselves, along with other evangelicals, struggling alongside secular Jews in the Holy Land for the inclusion of religious liberty in a document for basic human rights. Israel is an avowed Jewish homeland. The Palestinian Authority, while secular by profession, is heavily influenced by the Muslim majority. In the Knesset, or Israeli Parliament, numerous religious parties often determine the direction and legislation of the coalition government. Religious parties pressure the government to grant concessions to the religious establishment, in the form of Sabbath restrictions, kosher laws, and governmental posts for religious officials. When demands are not met, street demonstrations are common. The assassination of the Prime Minister by a religious Jew in 1995 shocked the nation, but seemed to have little effect on the national elections a year later. Jewish religious schools and seminaries, yeshivot, receive subsidies from the government. The government subsidizes the education of every qualified pupil. Christian schools receive support from the government Ministry of Education. The Nazareth Baptist School, one of the largest Christian schools in the country with 1,000 Arab students, receives hundreds of thousands of New Israeli Shekels each year in the form of government student grants, enabling it to be financially independent of its Southern Baptist sponsors. The school teaches Bible in class and holds regular chapels for religious inspiration. In the eyes of the average citizen of the Holy Land, it is the responsibility of schools to teach religion as part of the curriculum. In fact, the government pays a stipend to religious leaders in Muslim mosques. Priests of the Orthodox and Catholic churches teach religion in the public schools. Jewish religious schools receive generous government aid. When a local pastor recently asked a government official, &quot;Why do the evangelicals not receive the same benefit?&quot; he was told, &quot;Because you have not asked!&quot; Modern Marcionism Many clergy and laymen in the Orthodox Church and some evangelical Arab leaders do not believe in the inspiration of the Old Testament. Or, they hold to selective revelation, where some parts, perhaps the Prophets, are inspired, and others are not. This view coincides with their political experiences of losing land, home, and country to the &quot;Zionist invaders.&quot; They reject a God who would order the Children of Israel to slaughter men, women and children when they occupied the Promised Land. Their view is very similar to Marcion who was excommunicated by the Church Fathers in AD144. Marcion insisted that the Church had obscured the Gospel by seeking to combine it with Judaism. He maintained that the God of the Old Testament and the Jews is evil. He argued that a world which contains the suffering and cruelty, which we see all about us, must be the work of some evil being and not of a good God. A view of the Old Testament that rejects a God who commands the destruction of pagan cities borders on naiveté. The Canaanites, whom the Israelites invaded and destroyed, were offering their first born sons to the god, Moloch! The stench of human sacrifice was an affront to the God who created man in his own image. On the other hand, a romantic view of the Scriptures that sees the Jews as God&#39;s chosen people, who can commit no sin, is equally naïve, and leads some evangelical Christians to a wholesale endorsement of everything that Israel does. Both views distort the truth and are not affirmed by many Israelis and Bible-believing Christians. The whole counsel of Scriptural truth, mediated by love and forgiveness, can alone bring justice and healing to the Holy Land. Secular materialism Despite the overlay of religiosity that pervades the Holy Land and many of its people, secular materialism motivates the majority. Jesus said, &quot;Where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.&quot; The goal of the average Israeli, and others in the Holy Land, is to own a cottage or villa in suburbia, with an ornamental garden in a yard, surrounded by a white picket fence. More people realize this dream as the real gross domestic product rises to $14,700 per capita, three times that of the last generation. The &quot;good life&quot; is still the dream of most living in the Holy Land. Many acquire middle-class status with multiple cars, cable television, and higher education, along with other western &quot;blessings&quot; of divorce, abortion, and empty lives. Shopping malls abound throughout the land with the typical American varieties of McDonalds, Pizza Hut, and Kentucky Fried Chicken. The Visa Card and other forms of credit spending exert additional pressures on the household budgets of young Israeli couples. The closure of West Bank and Gaza, resulting from terrorist bombings, prevented Arab workers from entering Israel. The economic situation in the Palestinian Authority remains critical. At present, half the work force there is unemployed and the gross national product is $2,800 and $2,400 for West Bank and Gaza respectively. Over 250,000 foreign workers entered Israel from Eastern Europe, Latin America and Southeast Asia, due to the closure. Half these remain illegally in Israel. Secular materialism leaves a gaping void in the hearts of many in the Holy Land, after the initial spell wears off and the bills have to be paid. While they try to fill this void with every form of music, art, literature and a variety of exotic religions and philosophies, nothing meets the need like Jesus! Many foreign workers and immigrants gravitate toward international congregations throughout the land. This is one of the most fertile areas for church planting, not only in Hebrew, Arabic and English, but in Russian, Rumanian, Spanish, Amharic, Mandarin and other languages. Cable television carries Christian broadcasting into many areas, giving the general public access to the Gospel. Effective outreach takes place in Eilat and other areas of high tourist concentration. Spiritism New Age philosophy, Hinduism, Buddhism, and gurus are the &quot;in thing&quot; for the Israeli intelligentsia. Most Jewish young people leave the country once they serve their mandatory army service. Many travel to the east to India and Thailand to explore eastern religions. Those who return to Israel are unaware that they contradict the unity of God proclaimed in Judaism. Unfortunately, Judaism, Islam and even the traditional churches have within their religious system&#39;s forms of occult practice. Kabala, in Judaism, is replete with numerology and symbolism. Several Muslim sheiks, in Arab villages of Galilee, are popular for their ihjab or incantations and miracle cures using verses from the Quran. A certain priest was famous for finding dead bodies and lost objects through visions. The general population accepts these practices, but are unable to distinguish if they are from God, or from the devil. Others feel they are foolishness, but revert to them when under pressure. Patriarchal society Despite rapid modernization in the Holy Land, with modern highways, new cars, cable television, faxes, Internet and E-Mail, the inner psyche of the people still finds its source in the patriarchal society. This is especially true for the Arab population and the Eastern, or Sephardic Jews, who come from the Arab countries. The mindset of the patriarch is passed on into modern society through the centuries as people move from nomadic life to the villages and then into the cities. This especially applies to Muslim Arabs in the Holy Land, whom you find building high-rise apartments for the whole family to live in. Long-standing perspective sees the Middle Eastern family as a patriarchal (living in or adjacent to the father&#39;s residence) extended group, living in one household or connected dwellings. By this is meant a man, his wife, their unmarried children, and their married sons with their wives and children. Also in this typical arrangement, there is the rule by the father or eldest male (patriarchy) as well as reckoning the family by the father&#39;s name. As to marriage, the preference has been for mating within the family, especially the &quot;ideal&quot;, when possible, for cousins through their fathers to marry. This structure encapsulates the ideal family relationship pattern. It is what the family &quot;should&quot; be, even though the reality is seldom present today. The closeness of the patriarchal family commends itself when compared to the scattering and disunity of western families. But unfortunately, it fosters defects that cause endless strife in the homes of Arabs in the Holy Land. Rapid transition in Israel today from village life to urban city dwelling or university study places great strain on the traditional family structure. Young men gain financial independence through study and work. Young women are exposed to men of whom the patriarchal family may not approve. If a unmarried young Arab woman becomes sexually involved before marriage, it can bring dishonor to the family, and unfortunately, even in this modern age, result in her death at the hands of her father or another close relative. The same punishment is true of women who are suspected of being unfaithful to their husbands. Rapid transition threatens the authority of the patriarchal society. Nevertheless, male dominance still maintains a strong bastion in the Holy Land, in both Arab and Jewish homes. Tribal loyalties Loyalty to one&#39;s ancestral group, whether based on religion, nationality, or language, remains a characteristic of social ties in the Holy Land. Ancient tribal loyalties still run deep, though, on the surface, communities appear modern and advanced. George Jennings observes wisely that &quot;loyalties to kinship groups, which have a common ancestral father, who lived, perhaps, between three and seven generations before, is common in Middle Eastern groups.&quot; There was a time when it appeared that the power of tribe, or the hamula (Arabic) or the mishpaha (Hebrew) was being broken by political alliances. But the rise of both Muslim and Jewish fanaticism forces people back to their tribal loyalties. Tribal loyalties affect the make up of local churches, especially in the Arabic speaking areas. Villages and communities are structured around family groups. A pastor usually finds it much easier to attract people from his own family or tribe. When conflicts arise in the church, people instinctively side with their family, regardless of the situation. If the matter is not resolved to the liking of a member of the family, the entire family usually leaves in protest. Almost every Arab church I know has experienced a split because of family loyalty. On the positive side, hospitality to strangers and newcomers remains a common characteristic of many homes in the Holy Land. A guest customarily receives a cold drink of fruit juice, followed by fruit and sometimes cake. The visit ends with a cup of strong coffee. The guest is made to feel at home and conflict is usually avoided. Such ingratiation makes it difficult for the newcomer to ascertain the motives of his hosts. Jesus admonition to &quot;find someone worthy enough to have you as their guest and stay with them until you leave&quot; is still relevant for church planters in the highly tribal mindset of the Holy Land. If you make the mistake of entering the home of a person of bad reputation, or of a rival clan, you can affect your ministry negatively for years to come. On the other hand, if you choose your first contact wisely, your host can attract people to future ministries. Oral Communicators It would be natural to assume that with a literacy rate of 92% in Israel and 70% in the West Bank and Gaza, the people of the Holy Land would think and communicate logically. Not so! Experience shows that people in the Holy Land communicate orally. When you first see two Arabs or Jews talking with each other you get the impression they are having a fight! Hand waving, facial expressions and shouting all combine to make the expatriate think that combat is imminent. Then, before you know it, they part smiling! Cellular phones have become so popular in Israel that it was necessary to pass a law prohibiting their use while driving a car. The tendency for people to speak with their hands made it dangerous to hold a phone and the steering wheel at the same time! True, the average Jewish home has a large library of books, since Israelis are avid readers. But religious thought is often couched in parable or riddle, similar to oral communications. Prayers are chanted as the body sways, bringing to mind those who returned from exile riding on camels. Ask an Arab religious man, whether a Muslim sheik or a Christian priest, to quote a verse of his sacred Scripture and he will chant it! Storytelling is an obsession for Arabs. Logical thought escapes the Arab Muslim, but place a truth in story form and he will grasp it. Those who wish to share the truth about God in Christ in the Holy Land need to learn the art of story-telling the Gospel. This is why Jesus taught these peoples in parables. Semitic languages Probably the most formidable obstacle for expatriate evangelicals to overcome in order to plant the church in the Holy Land is the language barrier. The people of the land will tell you it takes two lifetimes to learn Hebrew and three lifetimes to learn Arabic! Hebrew and Arabic, both Semitic languages, share the same trilateral consonant base, but use different scripts. Hebrew lay dormant for almost 1900 years during the exile from the Holy Land, following the destruction of Jerusalem in AD 70. It was used only for religious purposes and in the small Jewish ghettos in the diaspora. It revived with the turn of the 20th Century and the Zionist movement to resettle the Holy Land. Now modern Hebrew is the spoken language of most Israelis. It relates to ancient Biblical Hebrew, but incorporates numerous foreign words. Arabic, on the other hand, remained the language of medicine, astronomy, geography, and philosophy throughout the Middle Ages. It is said to have around two million words in its vocabulary. Either language is a challenge to westerners, since it has no equivalents in the Latin-based languages. The shape and sound of each of these languages affects the mentality and lifestyle of Jews and Arabs, and their reactions to each other. Hebrew language, in its printed form, is written as a series of squares, each letter standing alone. It lends itself to sharp, logical thinking. The Hebrew Scriptures, the Torah, is composed of teaching and laws, which regulate the life of the Jewish people. Jewish life is therefore based on law and reciprocity. They tend to say what they think and mean what they say. They are formidable strategists. Arabic, on the other hand, is a series of swirls, all interconnected. Arabic calligraphy lines the walls of mosques, impressing upon worshippers the words of their scripture, the Quran, which is the &quot;speech of God.&quot; Muslim religious thought is ilm al-kalaam, or the &quot;science of speech.&quot; The force of an argument is not determined by logic, but by the fluency and force of the words with which it is pursued. Therefore, law and speech clash with each other, as Jews and Muslims seek to relate in the Holy Land. It is no wonder that outside mediators are necessary to help Jews and Arabs come to terms over their political struggles. Evangelicals must continue to play the role as mediators, as they see each group as estranged children of God who need to know the peace that Jesus gives through the Holy Spirit. Divisive spirit Tension pervades the atmosphere in the Holy Land due to the above characteristics of life. You feel it in the aggressive way people drive their cars. Road accidents remain the greatest killer. Just standing in line at a bank or grocery store can be a challenge to patience, as customers jostle to get ahead of others. Since much of the economy depends on the tourist trade, government tour guides and store clerks receive special training in relating to tourists and customers in a polite manner. Jews and Arabs live like walking time bombs, ready to explode at the least provocation. This comes as a surprise, when you know that each can be very hospitable in normal situations. Through the long centuries of being subjected people under foreign domination, the people of the Holy Land learned by instinct the practice of &quot;divide and conquer.&quot; Some have an instinctive ability of planting seeds of discord among brothers. This is particularly common in Muslim families. Distrust is, unfortunately, integral to the religion of Islam. The Quran indicates that if man thinks he can deceive God, God will deceive him. It also indicates that God can change the verses of the Quran by abrogating a verse and sending down a better one. This spirit of discord and deceit spills over into the Arab Christian community, causing distrust and conflict. The Jewish community remains continually suspicious of their own leaders, as the newspapers weekly describe the latest embezzlement or financial scandal. War Four times in the over thirty years we lived in the Holy Land, the accumulation of the above factors erupted into war. The combination of land, tribal religion and politics makes for a volatile mixture! My unfortunate observation is that if the Jews and Arabs did not have each other to fight, they would fight among themselves. They share all the weaknesses of sinful humanity. War remains a likely possibility for those who feel led to serve in the Holy Land. The people of the land weary from the loss of loved ones and long for peace. But they continue to live and survive in a climate of tension. Every new home in Israel must be equipped with a &quot;sealed room&quot; and bomb shelter. All citizens receive gas masks. Still life goes on. A businessman once asked me in Nazareth if I thought there was going to be another war soon? He said, &quot;If you can guarantee me five years of peace, I can build a hotel and make a profit!&quot; Every family in the Holy Land suffers from the losses of war. Refugees status Thousands of Arabs and Jews have been displaced from their homes and lands as a result of wars in the Holy Land. Almost half the population of Jordan, and sizable numbers of the inhabitants of Lebanon, are refugees from the recent wars between the Arabs and Jews. Large refugee camps remain in the West Bank and Gaza. The camps continue as breeding grounds for poverty and deep resentment of the Israelis who displaced them. The hopeless situation of the youth holed up in these camps contributes to the desperation that resulted in several suicide bombings inside Israel proper. The plight of the Palestinian refugees remains an unhealed sore in the psyche of the Arabs. Jews will never be at peace as long as the camps remain. The refugee situation will cry out for solution and remain a destabilizing factor in the region, even after the final settlement over Jerusalem is negotiated. The Jews of the Holy Land also suffer from centuries of refugee status. Many, now living in Israel, came as refugees from their countries of origin. Some, who formerly lived in Arab countries, were displaced because of the Arab-Jewish conflict. The negative experiences in Arab countries hardened some against feeling compassion for the Arab refugees. The irony of the refugee status of many Palestinian Arabs in the region is that they have become one of the most highly trained peoples in the Middle East. United Nations schools in the refugee camps have provided universal education for children of refugees. The Palestinians, similar to their Jewish cousins, are highly intelligent and energetic people. They have become the blue collar and white collar workers in Kuwait, Jordan, Lebanon, and many other countries in the area. Many have risen to academic level and scattered around the world in what has been called the &quot;Palestinian Diaspora.&quot; Occupation mentality The Holy Land suffered throughout history from one foreign occupation to another. The Romans, the Byzantines, the Muslims, the Crusaders, the Turkish, the British, and now, depending upon your political orientation, the Zionists, or the Palestinians, have all occupied the land! The people of the Holy Land lived under outside authority and power throughout their long history. The Jews have experienced statehood for less than fifty years, and the Palestinians still struggle to gain theirs. Foreign occupation stifled local initiative through the centuries. Foreign powers taxed the people and conscripted the youth into their armies. This led to deception as a way of life to survive politically and economically. Merchants practiced &quot;four pocket&quot; accounting. One pocket to bribe the official over you, one pocket to bribe the one under you, one pocket for taxes, and finally one pocket for yourself! Little wonder that tax systems are often excessive and distrust is rampant. People in the Holy Land did not show wealth until recently. Yards and entrances to homes were deliberately left dirty and unkempt. They threw garbage into the streets. Amazingly, the insides of homes were washed and scrubbed daily! People who live under occupation feel they are pawns of outside powers. They feel helpless to change their way of life. Occupation breeds contempt. Church leaders hesitate to step out in church planting, fearing failure or loss of control, even after years of living in freedom. They caution expatriates to avoid any political involvement that would jeopardize the church. We need to share that the New Testament is good news for those living under occupation. When Jesus taught, &quot;If any one forces you to go one mile, go with him two,&quot; he was teaching Jewish believers the ethics of how to deal with occupying Roman soldiers. Jesus and His Word is the Truth that sets men free. The Israeli Occupation Force arrested a Palestinian Arab believer in the West Bank and imprisoned him. He felt alone and deserted, without hope. One day a Jewish believer, serving in the Israeli army, saw the young Arab reading the Bible. He introduced himself as a believer and eventually gained the Arab&#39;s release. Outside the prison, they were able to fellowship together. Jesus breaks down the barriers between Jew and Arab caused by the occupation. Two traumatized peoples The Holy Land has been called the &quot;twice promised land.&quot; Some British politicians promised the land to the Jews as a result of their Christian Zionist ideology and political expedients. Others promised the Arabs statehood in return for support against the Turks during World War I. Both Jews and Arabs see their national and religious aspirations dependent on the same piece of land. The expatriate evangelical will feel caught in the middle and pulled both ways by the felt needs and aspirations of the Arabs and the Jews in the Holy Land. Once, while eating lunch in the dining hall of a prosperous kibbutz in Galilee, I innocently asked an older Jewish friend who lived on the kibbutz, whose land the kibbutz was built on? He exploded, &quot;How dare you ask that question after what you Americans did to the Indians!&quot; Then I realized that, before 1948, the land belonged to the Arabs. Many Jews and Arabs in the Holy Land still feel the trauma of displacement and the loss of loved ones. Before we judge, we need to admit our own past injustices. We cannot live continually in the past. There is a new desire in the hearts of many Jews and Arabs to settle past differences. The message of the Bible, that God forgives and changes men, needs to be shared continually. He alone heals the broken heart of past traumas. This is proven every time a Jew or an Arab confesses Jesus as Savior and lets the peace of God flood his heart. Jesus breaks down the &quot;middle wall of partition.&quot; Conclusion: What does all this tell us? God is at work in Israel-Palestine, the &quot;Holy Land,&quot; and around the Middle East. He is planting His Church, overcoming enormous obstacles, responding to the challenge of complex issues. The Gospel message has come back to Jerusalem for a reason. Could one reason be to model the initiative of God as host of the global Celebrate Messiah 2000 event at the end of the millenium? This may well be one of the most significant gatherings ever held, in the year that holds the greatest promise, and in the place that has the greatest significance. The gates of Hell will not prevail against the church or congregation that takes the keys of the Kingdom and unlocks the hearts of thousands of Arabs and Jews waiting for a word from God. Obviously, only the Messianic congregations and a few of the Arab groups have a purposeful plan to plant new congregations toward the goal of &quot;a church for every people and the gospel for every person.&quot; Where are we using all of our resources and energy if we are not following the mandate to plant churches? What could happen if all the evangelical churches and congregations, with one mind and heart, chose to follow God into the ripe harvest field, which is the Holy Land and the Middle East? You and I, who are part of the harvest force, need to answer these questions. We will be held accountable. Let us be good and faithful harvesters for that fateful day and bring in our sheaves rejoicing! Article source: http://www.ad2000.org/celebrate/setting.htm",

    "content": "The Call to North India: To the Uttermost Part Luis Bush By his breath the skies became fair; his hand pierced the gliding serpent. And these are but the outer fringe of his works (Job 16:13-14) As I look back over the past six years since the AD2000 &amp; Beyond Movement was launched, several key moments — “kairos” moments — stand out in my mind. The first was at the inaugural meeting of our movement in July, 1990, when it was recorded in our minutes that our primary target of concern would be the unevange- lized/unreached belt between 10 degrees north and 40 degrees north of the Equator and from West Africa to East Asia — an area of the world we designated the “10/40 Window.” The only possible way way to reach the people in the 10/40 Window was through concerted, global, fervent, focused prayer; so we prayed. Two worldwide seasons of prayer were conducted: first for the countries in the 10/40 Window in October, 1993; then for what we called the 100 “Gateway Cities” in October, 1995. The second “kairos” moment was in a meeting with all the national leaders at the Global Conference on World Evangelization in Korea in 1995. After a full day of hearing reports from many countries in the world about their initiatives and goals leading to the year 2000, we were all broken with a passion for the individual peo- ples and nations represented by those in our gathering. We realized that though much had been accomplished and much momentum was building around the world to accomplish our goal of “a church for every people and the gospel for every person by the year 2000,” we needed to be even more focused on what remained to be done. So Joshua Project 2000 was launched in 1995 as a five-year effort to identi- fy and reached the approximately 1,700 peoples whom mission leaders agreed are most in need of a church planting effort. We have been amazed at the tremendous energy and resources that Joshua Project 2000 has unleashed around the globe. Unreached peoples are being identified, researched, profiled and adopted as targets of focused, fervent prayer and outreach with an urgency that is unprecedented. I believe a third “kairos” moment is upon us now, especially for the church in North India. As you will see in the following pages, this part of the world is of enormous importance. The needs and the opportunities are staggering. And we believe God is moving there as never before. We can see “the outer fringe of His work” all around the area. The time is right. North India is poised to receive an outpouring of His grace and His glory. All the signs are there. It is my prayer that we will heed them and become a part of what God desires to do in this needy area of the world before the year 2000.

    "title": "Belo '97 Press Release - Brazilian Church Responds",
    "content": "Belo &#39;97 Press Release - Brazilian Church Responds Debbie Wood AD2000 Publications Director Gathering sets plans for strategic evangelism The census figures were like formidable dignitaries at the conference. Dour, no-nonsense, pinch-faced insisters on verifiable data. Despite flamboyant claims which have raced as high as 40 million evangelicals in the last decade (around 40% of the population), church growth in Brazil has, in reality, been steady since 1970 at a mere 5-6% per year. At that determined pace, the 150-year-old evangelical church in Brazil now numbers 17.8 million, or only 11%, of that predominantly Catholic country. The IBGE (the Brazilian census bureau) figures have been a reality-check for those prone to unbridled optimism. Their announcement at Belo 97, a national conference sponsored by the international evangelization movement, AD2000 and Beyond, and by Youth for Christ, in Belo, Brazil the last week in January, brought the previously jubilant crowd to a decidedly more sober character. The more than 3,000 delegates quickly grasped the realization that &quot;neighbor-reaching-neighbor&quot; evangelism would be inadequate to fulfil the mandate of the AD2000 movement &quot;a church for every people and the gospel for every person by the year 2000.&quot; The interior of the Northeast section of the country has only 3% evangelicals, with 222 municipalities having 1% or less, hardly enough to leaven those populations. In addition, there are 139 aboriginal tribes which have had no opportunity at all to hear the Gospel in their own language. The 2500 youth attending the conference were seen as the key to the cross-cultural missionaries needed and the 250 pastors and church leaders were not slow in figuring them into the national evangelization plans. National goals adopted at the conference included: Sending 50,000 new missionaries. This has been one of the special objectives of Wake Up Deborah!, a Brazilian prayer movement of mothers praying that their offspring would be called as missionaries. In the year and a half since its inception, Wake Up has 20,000 registered mothers praying 15 minutes per day and meeting monthly for corporate prayer and testimony. Adopting (taking cooperative responsibility for planting churches among): all 139 of Brazil&#39;s unreached aboriginal groups, the 222 Brazilian towns with less than 1% evangelicals, 173 (10%) of the unreached groups on the AD2000 list of the 1739 least-reached peoples of the world (the Joshua Project 2000 list). In order to facilitate these adoptions, Adopt-A-People of Brazil presented an adoption kit containing a manual, colored transparencies, prayer cards and a video, for use by Brazilian churches willing to take a small piece of the responsibility. The results of the congress traveled far beyond the few thousand present. Trans World Radio beamed the sessions all over the region. Phone lines were kept busy with incoming requests for more information. One Brazilian television hostess invited the AD2000 leaders to be guests on 15 upcoming editions of her daily talk show. While Brazil is home to the third largest body of evangelicals in the world, and currently sends 1700 missionaries, the history of the evangelical church is not one of cooperation, but fragmentation, along doctrinal, denominational, and geographical faults. Oswaldo Prado, the leader of AD2000 in Brazil, called for repentance and unity among Christians in order for the conference goals to have any hope of success. While statistics failed to validate the meteoric growth curve often touted in world Christian circles, church growth remains healthy. Since the population growth is less than half the rate of church growth, the church continues to gain ground at a steady pace. Speakers may still have grist for their superlatives, if they should live so long. If the rate continues through the first half of the next century, Brazil will be 50% evangelical by the year 2045.

    "title": "Awakening 2000 Brings Leaders Together to Plan and Pray for Australia",
    "content": "Awakening 2000 Brings Leaders Together to Plan and Pray for Australia Ramon Williams Awakening 2000 was officially launched before over 50 church leaders and representatives in St Andrew&#39;s House, Sydney on Friday September 20. Previous projects were reported, results shared and future challenges faced. One of the most moving moments came when over 50 leaders divided into groups of 3-4 to pray for the future plans and the future outreaches to the people of Australia, with the Gospel message in a language and culture they can understand. The Chairman of the NSW Advisory Board, the Rev. Ken Cornwell, chaired the meeting which heard reports from Pastor Alan White of Forestville, viewed video footage from the various TV news coverages of the Easter Awakenings and Global Marches around Australia and were challenged by the National Co-ordinator, Mal Garvin, on plans and projects of the future. A report from Wollongong, South of Sydney, highlighted the need of prayers for a region. It is in that area that prayer gatherings have been taking place on the mountains and high peaks surrounding the city. Training days and central gatherings have been held as leaders and ordinary Christians have networked together, with a common goal. Other regions have seen the results and are now considering similar approaches themselves. Within the Awakening 2000 organisation, over 100 manuals have now been produced to help churches train and prepare for a wide variety of events and outreaches. Churches of Christ pastor, Ross Wakeley, reported on team visits to Wagga and Bathurst, with plans underway for visits to Nowra and &quot;the bush&quot; - country towns further West. Where ever the teams visited, church leaders came together, &quot;as never before&quot;, to discuss reaching their area for Christ. Fun days for all the families were a success in reaching the unchurched. &quot;Many families would never go to church - so the church went to them,&quot; said Mr Wakeley. Martin Wood has recently returned from South Africa where he shared the concept and training manuals with keen and eager Christians in that land, through an invitation by African Enterprise&#39;s co-ordinator, Michael Cassidy. Mal Garvin then presented &quot;The Next Step&quot;. He spoke of new battles taking place, throughout New Zealand, Canada and South Africa, where the Church is challenged with the need to &quot;grow up - learning from experience&quot;. In New Zealand plans are underway for a new and novel outreach in January 1997. In two weeks he will be sharing with leaders in Canada something of the lessons learnt and how to work together as a team. The goal in Australia, is to reach 1 in 12 Aussies with the Gospel within the next twelve months. Then 6 in 12 the following year, followed by 9 in 12 leading up to the year 2000. &quot;The next two years are pivotal to the whole picture,&quot; said Mr Garvin. Without financial support and volunteers, the task will never be done. Bishop Brian King told of plans being formed for the outreach, service to others and plans for a chapel in the Olympic village, during the Sydney Olympics in September, 2000. &quot;The preparing stage is past. The planning stage is underway and the performing era will commence in 1999,&quot; said Bishop King. Michael Cleary brought the final challenge. &quot;Behind all this is an organisation,&quot; said Mr Cleary. &quot;These are special times for the Church in Australia. We&#39;ve been encouraged as we have reviewed videos of past events, but there&#39;s a whole new task lying ahead of us&quot;. He appealed for involvement and financial support as never before. Regional Training Days will be held during November. Manuals will be finalised. Participants are needed for raising finance; gathering teams for prayer; media personnel or those interested in reaching the media, can be used in every town and city; regional action groups need to be formed; leaders and teams of workers are needed for local events...and so the lists go on. The call went out for those with a heart for evangelism to become involved in Awakening 2000, which will never be achieved unless there are more workers. The closing moment and climax of the Awakening 2000 Launch was the sight of the known and respected leaders, joining together in small groups, to pray for the nation and the fulfilment of Awakening 2000 goals - to reach out with the Gospel to those who have never heard. For further information, details on manuals available and how to become involved, contact Awakening 2000 offices in each state.

    "title": "What is the 10/40 Window?",
    "content": "What is the 10/40 Window? The Moroccan Arabs in Morocco are a large unreached people groups in the 10/40 Window. The 10/40 Window is the rectangular area of North Africa, the Middle East and Asia approximately between 10 degrees north and 40 degrees north latitude. The 10/40 Window is often called &quot;The Resistant Belt&quot; and includes the majority of the world&#39;s Muslims, Hindus, and Buddhists. The original 10/40 Window included only countries with at least 50% of their land mass within 10 and 40 degrees north latitude. The revised 10/40 Window includes several additional countries that are close to 10 or 40 degrees north latitude and have high concentrations of unreached peoples. See the original and revised country lists on this page. Approximately 4.89 billion individuals residing in approximately 8,213 distinct people groups are in the revised 10/40 Window. 5,626 (68.5%) of these people groups are considered unreached and have a population of 3.02 billion. This means approximately 62% of the individuals in the 10/40 Window live in an unreached people group. The 10/40 Window is home to some of the largest unreached people groups in the world such as the Shaikh, Yadava, Turks, Moroccan Arabs, Pashtun, Jat and Burmese. The 10/40 Window is home to some of the largest unreached people groups in the world. The 10/40 Window has several important considerations: first, the historical and Biblical significance; second, the least evangelized countries; third, the unreached people groups and cities; fourth, the dominance of three religious blocs; fifth, the preponderance of the poor; sixth, the strongholds of Satan within the 10/40 Window. The 10/40 Window: Historical and Biblical Significance The first and most fundamental reason why followers of Jesus Christ ought to focus on the 10/40 Window is because of the Biblical and historical significance of this area. The Bible begins with the account of Adam and Eve placed by God in the heart of what is now the 10/40 Window. God&#39;s plan, expressed in Genesis 1:26, was that mankind should have dominion over the earth, subduing it fully. However, Adam and Eve sinned against God and forfeited their right to rule. Man&#39;s sinful behavior increased until God intervened and judged the earth with a cataclysmic flood. Then came man&#39;s futile attempt to establish new dominion in the building of the great Tower of Babel. That effort, which also occurred in the heart of the 10/40 Window, was an open defiance against God. Once again, God reached forth His hand in judgment. The result was the introduction of different languages, the scattering of earth&#39;s people, and the formation of nations. The 10/40 Window is home to the majority of the world&#39;s unevangelized countries. The 10/40 Window: The Least Evangelized Countries The 10/40 Window is home to the majority of the world&#39;s unevangelized countries. The &quot;unevangelized&quot; are people who have a minimal knowledge of the gospel, but have no valid opportunity to respond to it. While it constitutes only one-third of earth&#39;s total land area, nearly two-thirds of the world&#39;s people reside in the 10/40 Window. The original 10/40 Window included only countries with at least 50% of their land mass within 10 and 40 degrees north latitude. The revised 10/40 Window removes several Christianized countries such as South Korea and the Philippines and includes several additional countries, such as Indonesia, that are close to 10 or 40 degrees north latitude and have high concentrations of unreached peoples. See the original and revised country lists. These lists include both sovereign states and non-sovereign dependencies. The 10/40 Window: The Unreached Peoples and Cities An estimated 3.02 billion individuals live in approximately 5,626 unreached people groups in the 10/40 Window. The 10/40 Window also contains the largest unreached peoples over one million in population. In addition, the 10/40 Window contains the overwhelming majority of the world&#39;s least evangelized megacities -- that is those with a population of more than one million. The top 50 least evangelized megacities are all in the 10/40 Window! That fact alone underscores the need for prioritizing 10/40 Window Great Commission efforts. The 10/40 Window contains four of the world&#39;s dominant religious blocs. The 10/40 Window: The Dominance of Three Religious Blocs The 10/40 Window contains four of the world&#39;s dominant religious blocs. The majority of the followers of Islam, Hinduism, and Buddhism as well as the Non-Religious block live within the 10/40 Window. On the left side or western part of the 10/40 Window, the Muslim world can be seen most prominently in a wide band across the north of Africa into the Middle East. South Asia, in the middle of the 10/40 Window, is the heart of Hinduism with its 330 million gods. Buddhism influences the right side or eastern part of the 10/40 Window. Buddhism is the primary religion in Southeast Asia and although officially an atheistic country since the Marxist revolution of the late 1940s, China is nevertheless deeply influenced by its Buddhist roots. The 10/40 Window: The Preponderance of the Poor The 10/40 Window is home to the majority of the world&#39;s poor. Of the poorest of the poor, more than eight out of ten live in the 10/40 Window. On average, they exist on less than a few hundred dollars per person per year. It has been said that &quot;the poor are the lost, and the lost are the poor&quot; as the majority of the unreached live in the poorest countries of the world. There is a remarkable overlap between the poorest countries of the world and those that are least evangelized. The 10/40 Window: Spiritual Stronghold The Yadav in India are one of the largest unreached people groups in the 10/40 Window. The 10/40 Window includes numerous spiritual strongholds. The billions of people who live in the 10/40 Window have suffered not only the ravages of poverty and disease, they have also been kept from the transforming power of the Gospel. They are poignant examples of the truth expressed in 2 Corinthians 4:4, which states that &quot;the god of this age has blinded the minds of unbelievers, so that they cannot see the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God.&quot; The 10/40 Window: A Renewed Focus The focus of the Christian missions community 200 years ago was for the coastlands of the world. A century later, the success of the coastlands effort motivated a new generation to reach the interior regions of the continents. Within the past several decades, the success of the inland thrust has led to a major focus on people groups. Today, followers of Christ are concentrating their efforts on the unreached peoples of the world, most of which are in the 10/40 Window.

    "content": "The 10/40 Window - What You Can Do There are several important ways in which your church or prayer group can become involved in advancing the AD2000 &amp; Beyond Movement and focusing attention on The 10/40 Window. Consider these possibilities: Establish an AD2000 Task Force Form a task force of individuals who are committed to pray for the evangelization of the world for Christ. Select a name of your group such as &quot;AD2000 Task Force&quot; or &quot;AD2000 Committee.&quot; Assign responsibilities within the task force, including communication with church and ministry leaders, promotion, leadership of prayer groups, etc. Select An Unreached People, A Least Evangelized City and Country Select one unreached people group to adopt.

    "title": "The 10/40 Window - Getting to the Core of the Core",
    "content": "The 10/40 Window - Getting to the Core of the Core The core of the unreached people of our world live in a rectangular-shaped window! Often called &quot;The Resistant Belt&quot;, the window extends from West Africa to East Asia, from ten degrees north to forty degrees north of the equator. This specific region, which has increasingly become known as The 10/40 Window, encompasses the majority of the world&#39;s Muslims, Hindus, and Buddhists -- billions of spiritually impoverished souls. As we approach the end of this millennium, it is imperative that out evangelistic efforts be focused among the people who inhabit The 10/40 Window. If we are serious in our commitment to provide a valid opportunity for every person to experience the truth and saving power of Jesus Christ, we cannot ignore the compelling realities within this region. The 10/40 Window confronts us with several important considerations: first, the historical and biblical significance; second, the least evangelized countries; third, the dominance of three religious blocs; fourth, the preponderance of the poor; fifth, the unreached ethnolinguistic people groups; sixth, the least evangelized megacities; and seventh, the strongholds of Satan within The 10/40 Window. The first and most fundamental reason why committed Christians must focus on The 10/40 Window is because of the biblical and historical significance of this area. Indeed, the Bible begins with the account of Adam and Eve placed by God in the heart of what is now The 10/40 Window. God&#39;s plan, expressed in Genesis 1:26, was that mankind should have dominion over the earth, subduing it fully. However, Adam and Eve sinned against God and forfeited their right to rule. Man&#39;s sinful behavior increased until God intervened and judged the earth with a cataclysmic flood. Then came man&#39;s futile attempt to establish new dominion in the building of the great Tower of Babel. That effort, which also occurred in the heart of The 10/40 Window, was an open defiance against God. Once again, God reached forth His hand in judgment. The result was the introduction of different languages, the scattering of earth&#39;s people, and the formation of nations. 10/40 Window Facts: An astonishing 97% of the persons who inhabit the least evangelized countries live in The 10/40 Window. In The 10/40 Window we can see clearly the crucial truth expressed in Graham Scroggie&#39;s book The Drama of World Redemption: &quot;A world having turned from God, He left it and chose a man through whom He would ultimately by Christ reach the world.&quot; Certainly we can see how ancient history ran its course in the territory marked by The 10/40 Window, from the cradle of civilization in Mesopotamia across the fertile crescent to Egypt. Empires rose and fell. The fate of God&#39;s people Israel varied in relation to their obedience to His covenant. It was here that Christ was born, lived a perfect life, died sacrificially on the cross, and rose triumphant over death. The church age was ushered in, and it was not until the second missionary journey of the Apostle Paul that events of biblical history occurred outside The 10/40 Window. Without question, this is an area of great biblical and historical significance. The second reason why committed Christians should focus on The 10/40 Window is because it is home to the majority of the world&#39;s unevangelized people. The &quot;unevangelized&quot; are people who have a minimal knowledge of the gospel, but have no valid opportunity to respond to it. While it constitutes only one-third of earth&#39;s total land area, nearly two-thirds of the world&#39;s people reside in The 10/40 Window. With a population nearing four billion, The 10/40 Window includes 59 countries, both sovereign states and non-sovereign dependencies. Those countries with the majority of their land mass lying within the boundaries of The 10/40 Window are included. A list of countries in The 10/40 Window. Of the world&#39;s 50 least evangelized countries, 37 are within The 10/40 Window. Yet those 37 countries comprise 97% of the total population of the 50 least evangelized countries! Such a fact leaves no doubt that our challenge in reaching the unreached must center on the core -- The 10/40 Window. If we take seriously the mandate to preach the gospel to every person, to make disciples of all peoples, and to be Christ&#39;s witnesses to the uttermost part of the earth, we must recognize the priority of concentrating our efforts on The 10/40 Window. No other area is so blatantly in need of the truth that salvation is only in Jesus Christ. A third reason we must focus on The 10/40 Window is evident in the fact that it contains three of the world&#39;s dominant religious blocs. The majority of those enslaved by Islam, Hinduism, and Buddhism live within The 10/40 Window. 2.7 Billion Buddhists, Hindus and Muslims in The 10/40 Window Viewing the map on page three from left&lt;&gt; to right, the Muslim world can be seen most prominently in a wide band across the north of Africa into the Middle East, a bloc representing over 700 million. On the right side of the map is the Buddhist world, encompassing the whole of China. From its center in The 10/40 Window, Islam is reaching out energetically to all parts of the globe; in similar strategy, we must penetrate the heart of Islam with the liberating truth of the gospel. We must do all in our power to show Muslims that the highest prophet described in the Koran is not Mohammed, but Jesus Christ. And that He is not only the greatest prophet, but the Son of God Himself who died and resurrected in order that millions of Muslims may be saved. 10/40 Window Facts: Projected populations by the year 2000 AD: 1.1 billion Muslims; 1.0 billion Hindus; and 600 million Buddhists. Overwhelmed with poverty and ravaged by disease, India is victimized even more severely by the spiritual blindness of Hinduism. To a nation in which fattened cows roam freely among emaciated humans, we must proclaim the truth that Jesus came to give us life, and give it abundantly. Although officially an atheistic country since the Marxist revolution of the late 1940s, China is nevertheless influenced deeply by its Buddhist roots. Some scholars, in fact, consider China&#39;s true religion to be combination of atheism and Buddhism. In actuality, religion in China is a hodgepodge which includes folklore, mysticism, animism, and occult practices. Regardless of how one may assess the situation, the fact remains that 1.2 billion Chinese are in desperate need of Jesus Christ. They represent the largest identifiable bloc within The 10/40 Window. A fourth reason we must focus on The 10/40 Window is because the poor are there. Of the poorest of the poor, more than eight out of ten live in The 10/40 Window. On average, they exist on less than $500 per person per year. Although 2.4 billion of these people live within The 10/40 Window, only 8% of all missionaries work among them. 82% of the Poorest of the Poor Live in The 10/40 Window Brent L. Myers, in his perceptive article entitled, &quot;Where Are The Poor And Lost?&quot;, states that &quot;the poor are the lost, and the lost are the poor.&quot; He arrived at this conclusion after illustrating that the majority of the unreached live in the poorest countries of the world. When Christians from 170 countries gathered at Lausanne II in Manila in 1989, great concern was expressed for the materially poor. In the second section of the Manila Manifesto, that concern was recorded in the following declaration: &quot;We have again been confronted with Luke&#39;s emphasis that the gospel is good news for the poor (Luke 4:18, 6:20, 7:22) and have asked ourselves what this means to the majority of the world&#39;s population who are destitute, suffering and oppressed. We have been reminded that the law, the prophets, the wisdom books, and the teaching and ministry of Jesus all stress God&#39;s concern for the materially poor and our consequent duty to defend and care for them.&quot; Committed Christians cannot ignore the reality that there is a remarkable overlap between the poorest countries of the world and those that are least evangelized. The fifth reason we must address our concerns on The 10/40 Window is because it contains the largest spiritually bankrupt ethnolinguistic megapeoples (over one million). In fact, over 90% of the individuals in these people groups live in The 10/40 Window. A list of the Least Evangelized Megacities in The 10/40 Window. The sixth major reason we must focus on The 10/40 Window is because it contains the overwhelming majority of the world&#39;s least evangelized megacities -- that is those with a population of more than one million. Of the top 50 cities on this list, all 50 are in The 10/40 Window! That fact alone underscores the need for prioritizing our efforts to reach each of these great metroplexes with Christ&#39;s love and truth. Reason number seven for focusing on The 10/40 Window is that it includes numerous strongholds of Satan. The billions of people who live in The 10/40 Window have suffered not only the ravages of poverty and disease, they have also been kept from the transforming power of the gospel. They are poignant examples of the truth expressed in 2 Corinthians 4:4, which states that &quot;the god of this age has blinded the minds of unbelievers, so that they cannot see the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God.&quot; We must not view this situation with a fatalistic attitude, for we have been granted power to intervene. In a later passage of the same letter, the Apostle Paul declares: &quot;For though we live in the world, we do not wage ware as the world does. The weapons we fight with are not weapons of the world. On the contrary, they have divine power to demolish strongholds&quot; (2 Corinthians 10:3-4). Although Satan has established a territorial stronghold in The 10/40 Window, we must not concede one parcel of land nor one person. The gospel must advance. Looking back across the pages of history we discover a heartening story about spiritual warfare in the writings of the prophet Daniel. A fervent man of prayer, Daniel was highly esteemed by God and by the people of his generation. On one occasion, while waiting on God in prayer, Daniel fasted on bread and water for three weeks. Finally a majestic angel whose appearance was as lightning brought an answer to his prayer. He assured Daniel with the promise that &quot;...your words were heard, and I have come in response to your words&quot; (Daniel 10:12). However, the angel then went on to explain how, en route to answer Daniel&#39;s prayer, he was detained for 21 days by the demon assigned to the Persian king (Daniel 10:13). It was only when the archangel Michael arrived to help that he was able to free himself from the battle to go to Daniel. This fascinating passage unveils the reality and territorial nature of the spiritual battle in the heavenlies. The angel who visited Daniel announced that he would have to return to the battle over the Persian kingdom. Apparently, that battle still rages, for ancient Persia is now modern-day Iran. Still a stronghold zealously held by Satan, Iran is situated at the center of The 10/40 Window. 10/40 Window Facts: 2.4 billion people -- 40% of the world&#39;s population -- live on less then $1.40 per day in The 10/40 Window. George Otis, Jr., has concluded that two powerful demonic forces, with great biblical significance, stand at the epicenter of the unreached world -- the prince of Persia (Iran) and the spirit of Babylon (Iraq) -- and both much be penetrated with the gospel before the Great Commission can be completed. Otis observes that this will occur in the region of the Garden of Eden, where the command to &quot;subdue the earth&quot; was originally given. It is evident that the forces of Satan have great power and will resist all attempts to be overcome. If we are to storm the enemy&#39;s territory, we must put on the full armor of God and fight with the weapons of spiritual warfare described in Ephesians 6. To depend on anything less is utter foolishness. The leaders of the AD2000 Movement are in full agreement that our greatest challenge in the final years of this century is to provide a valid opportunity for every people, every city, every person to experience the truth and saving power of Jesus Christ. The goal of the AD2000 &amp; Beyond Movement is a church for every people and the gospel for every person by the year 2000. The focus of the concern Christian community 200 years ago was for the coastlands of the world. A century later, the success of the coastlands effort motivated a new generation to reach the interior regions of the continents. Within the past decades, the success of the inland thrust has led to a major focus on people groups. More recently, the world&#39;s burgeoning megacities have also become focal points of concern. Today, rapidly approaching the third millennium since Christ, we are wise to concentrate our efforts on The 10/40 Window. Of course, this calls for some of us to reevaluate priorities. We must fin the most innovative ways to reach the billions of people within The 10/40 Window with the love and truth of Jesus Christ. We must mobilize for a massive prayer focus on The 10/40 Window with the body of Christ worldwide. However, it must be clearly understood that concentration on The 10/40 Window does not mean a curtailing of Christ&#39;s work going on elsewhere around the globe. Missionary endeavors in evangelism, training, relief, development, church planting, and mobilization for cross-cultural missions should go on unhindered. If we are faithful to the Scriptures, obedient to the mandate of Christ, and unwavering in our commitment to plant churches within every people and city by AD 2000, then we will get to the core of the core -- The 10/40 Window. May God grant each of us boldness and wisdom and energy to do our part in taking on this great and eternally significant challenge. For more information about what you can do, click here.

    "title": "The Unfinished Task, It Can be Done",
    "content": "The Unfinished Task God is on the move! He is superintending the events of our time. He is the source of the world’s growing spiritual thirst. That means that now is the time to act! It was nearly two thousand years ago that Jesus challenged His Church with the Great Commission to make disciples of all nations. Today, as we rapidly approach the 21st century, we are nearing a milestone that Christians once only dreamed of reaching. Within sight for the first time ever is a goal that for centuries has ignited the hearts of missionaries: “A church for every people and the Gospel for every person.” This great “Unfinished Task” is the motivational goal of the AD2000 &amp; Beyond Movement—not only that it be done, but that it be done by the end of the millennium—by December 31, 2000! Perhaps this overwhelming goal sounds too ambitious, too far-reaching. But consider for a moment Coca-Cola’s well-publicized goal to place “a Coke in the hand of every person on earth by the year 2000.” If reaching the entire world with a soft drink is not too ambitious for a business corporation, how much more should Christ’s own Church be committed to reaching that same world, in the same time frame, with the saving Gospel of Jesus Christ? A hundred years ago, evangelist D. L. Moody said concerning the spread of the Gospel to the whole world by the end of 1900, “It can be done; it ought to be done; it must be done.” However, five years before the end of the century, his colleague, A.T. Pierson, conceded, “We despaired of hope.” Today, a few years before the end of our century and millennium, hope and anticipation have regained the upper hand over despair and pessimism. More than 4,000 Christian leaders representing 186 countries have committed themselves in writing to the goal of a church for every people and the Gospel for every person by the year 2000. With that common goal in sight, they gathered in May of 1995 for the Global Consultation on World Evangelization (GCOWE ‘95) in Seoul, Korea, which Ralph Winter—founder of the U.S. Center for World Mission—said may have been “the most strategic Christian gathering in history.” It is apparent, then, that many Christian leaders from around the world believe “The Unfinished Task” can indeed be finished. They have committed themselves and their resources to the effort, joining hands to seek completion of the task in this century. Embracing the conviction of D. L. Moody, they have accepted even more strongly that, “It can be done; it ought to be done; it must be done.” It Can Be Done! The first thing we must understand about the goal of “a church for every people and the Gospel for every person” is that the greatest portion of the task has already been done. As Operation World author Patrick Johnstone (Chairman of the AD2000 Unreached Peoples Network) has observed, “There is cause for much praise to God in the progress over the past 200 years, and more especially in the past 30, and cautious hope for the initial attainment of our goals.” ...

    "title": "GCOWE '95 Introduction: Report by Brigada",
    "content": "GCOWE &#39;95 Introduction: Report by Brigada Doug Lucas GCOWE &#39;95 We are gathered here with the rich heritage of those who have gone before us. We are here in a spirit of repentance... repenting for our lack of heart, vision, our lack of compassion, our bigotry, our prejudice. Yet grateful for the blood of Jesus that still cleanses us from all of our sin. Thankful for the power of Jesus that enables us to go on. Grateful for those who have gone before. We meet in the tradition of Berlin 1966 and wholeheartedly share this day its aim of the proclamation of the gospel throughout the world with the very same time target. The Berlin &#39;66 call was to proclaim the gospel within a generation; as a generation is 40 years or so, they were calling for the proclamation of the gospel by the year 2000 or just beyond. We are indebted to the Lausanne I gathering in 1974 with nearly 2500 participants from 150 countries, and share wholeheartedly its goals even as we meet now at GCOWE &#39;95: 1) to impart a vision and a sense of responsibility for evangelism both locally and globally, 2) to inform people of successful methods and tools, 3) to facilitate evangelical cooperation in evangelism and 4) to identify unevangelized areas. We wholeheartedly follow in the footsteps of the theme and vision of Lausanne II in Manila 1989 with the call to &quot;Proclaim Christ Until He Comes.&quot; It was at that meeting following the plenary session on AD 2000 that a significant group met together and almost unanimously called for the establishment of a group to carry forward the AD 2000 vision. This has been done, pressed forward by countrywide initiatives to the year 2000 with some 2000 individual plans of evangelism directed to the year 2000. So we add with many, our aim in this movement and this consultation of &quot;a church for every people and the gospel for every person by the year 2000&quot;. And so we are committed to take up the torch for this special kairos decade of evangelism... a decade of harvest, decade of Holy Spirit anointing , decade of great expectations, even so to dissolve as a structure December 31, 2001. We have been criticized of reductionism_i.e. reducing the gospel and its implications to a time frame, to measurable objectives. However, we embrace the Lausanne covenant and proclaim a whole gospel, not a truncated gospel, not a mutilated gospel with all of its demands, but with the fruit of repentance. We embrace the Great Commission Manifesto, drafted at GCOWE &#39;89 in Singapore, which states so clearly, &quot;The Good News of Jesus Christ brings special meaning to suffering humanity. God&#39;s love brings hope to those who live under the bondage of sin, and who are victims of poverty and injustice. We believe that Christians involved in world evangelization should live among people as servants and minister to the needs of the whole person.&quot; In fact, the primary though not exclusive focus of the AD 2000 &amp; Beyond Movement is on the 10/40 Window, precisely because it is where humanity suffers more than any other region in the earth; whether it is spiritual suffering through ignorance of the gospel, human suffering due to oppression, human suffering due to poverty, human suffering due to infant mortality, human suffering due to early deaths, human suffering due to high rates of illiteracy, human suffering due to the historic bondages and alliances made with Satan himself, it is there! Through our purpose statement we seek to be servant-catalysts, seeking to encourage, motivate and network men and women church leaders by inspiring them with the vision of reaching the unreached by the year 2000 through consultations, prayer efforts and communication materials. The expected result is the establishment of a mission-minded church planting movement within every unreached and unevangelized people and city by AD 2000, so that all peoples might have a valid opportunity to experience the love, truth and saving power of Jesus Christ in fellowship with other believers. We are not seeking to plant a mutilated church, but rather, as it says in the very last statement of the Great Commission Manifesto: &quot;Establish a Christian community of worship, instruction in the word, healing, fellowship, prayer, disciple making, evangelism, and missionary concern in every human community,&quot; that Christ may become incarnate in all of His fullness, in all of who He is in each community. Do the advocates of social involvement have a home in AD 2000? They most certainly do. Can they have full citizenship in AD 2000? They are most welcome. However, this is not a conference to discuss the content of the gospel but how to communicate it. This is not a conference to discuss the nature of the church but how can we saturate the world with the church of our Lord so that the earth is full of His glory as the waters cover the sea. Our concern is getting that job done. And we believe that it can be done by the year 2000. &quot;We believe&quot; as the Great Commission Manifesto states, &quot;that it is possible to bring the Gospel to all people by the year 2000.&quot; And so to the question posed in the Manila Manifesto edited by John Stott and others at Lausanne II as it reads: &quot;Now the year 2000 has become for many a challenging milestone. Can we commit ourselves to evangelize the world during the last decade of this millennium?&quot; We would say a resounding, &quot;Yes.&quot; As it went on to say: &quot;There is nothing magical about the date, yet should we not do our best to reach this goal?&quot; Again our answer is: &quot;Yes, we should.&quot; Would you say with me: &quot;Yes we should.&quot; Would you stand and say with me: &quot;Yes we should.&quot; &quot;Christ commands us to take the gospel to all people. The task is urgent. We are determined to obey Him with joy and hope.&quot; Article source: http://www.ad2000.org/gcowe95/brigada/delegate-intro.html",

    "title": "A Brief Historical Overview of the AD2000 & Beyond Movement and Joshua Project 2000",
    "content": "A Brief Historical Overview of the AD2000 &amp; Beyond Movement and Joshua Project 2000 A Paper presented at the North East Asia AD2000/Joshua Project 2000 Consultation in Seoul, May 27-30, 1996 by Luis Bush, International Director Introduction In January 1989 participants at GCOWE &#39;89 in Singapore, learned that there were over 2,000 separate plans relating to world evangelization at the time. More evangelization plans focused on the year 2000 were being announced almost every week.. This perception of AD 2000 as a magnetic target has grown over the past twenty years, but only in recent years has it become a primary focus of many in the church. One-third of these programs are from the Two Thirds world--this is truly a global evangelization movement. Although most of these plans were born independently of each other, there was a felt need among the leaders involved for greater mutual awareness of their efforts to mobilize the worldwide body of Christ for world evangelization by AD 2000. This cooperation has happened! How did it begin? A River of Life At GCOWE I in Singapore in January 1989, during the last plenary session on the subject of the Fulfillment of the vision, the emerging AD2000 &amp; Beyond Movement was seen as a series of life giving streams flowing into a fast flowing river-- which beautifully pictures the movement that has carried us to this North East Asia AD2000/Joshua Project 2000 Consultation in Seoul. At the &quot;beginning&quot; of time God placed Adam in an earthly paradise. It was in a garden called Eden, which means delight, that God placed the first man according to the record of the Scriptures. A river, watering the garden, flowed from Eden. That river was a symbol of God&#39;s abundant supply watering the trees and vegetation of the garden to provide food and shade for man&#39;s physical needs. At the &quot;end&quot; of time, as recorded in the very last chapter of biblical revelation, we also find a river flowing. This is called the river of life. It is life-giving. The water is clear as crystal and flows from the very throne of God and of the Lamb down the middle of the great street of the city. On each side of this river stands a tree yielding fruit every month. &quot;And the leaves of the tree are the healing of the nations. (Rev, 22:2b). That&#39;s the end of the story. In the Bible the river graphically pictures the &quot;blessing&quot; of God as in these first and last references in the Scripture. In Isaiah 44:3, the river refers to the &quot;presence&quot; of God: For I will pour water on the thirsty land, and streams on the dry ground; I will pour out my Spirit on your offspring, and my blessing on your descendants. It refers to the &quot;peace&quot; of God in Isaiah 66:12: I will extend peace like a river. In Psalm 36:8 it refers to the &quot;provision&quot; of God: They feast on the abundance of your house; you give them drink from your river of delights. In John 7:38 it pictures the &quot;power&quot; of God in the life of the believer: Whoever believes in me, as the Scripture has said, streams of living water will flow from within him. In the Scripture, rivers also frame the &quot;plan&quot; of God by depicting geographical boundaries as in the promise to Abraham regarding the land of Israel: To your descendants I give this land, from the River of Egypt to the great river, the Euphrates (Gen. 15:17). Summarizing from the Biblical revelation, the river normally represents the people of God. It is, in fact, a vivid picture of the people of God in motion: being fruitful, acknowledging the presence of God, experiencing the peace of God, receiving the provision of God, knowing the power of God to fulfill the plan of God. God&#39;s people in motion, as a source of spiritual life in a parched, dry world. &quot;See I am doing a new thing! Now it springs up; do you not perceive it? I am making a way in the desert and streams in the wasteland.&quot; (Isaiah 43:19) This, in my view, is the biblical picture of what today is the AD2000 &amp; Beyond Movement. For example, you can trace the stream of life-giving water of regional movements from the two-thirds world such as the CCCOWE--a world evangelization movement among the Chinese churches worldwide, as well as COMIBAM, a world evangelization movement springing up from Latin America. In fact, it was in May 1987 that Dr. Thomas Wang, having been called from CCCOWE to become the International Director of the Lausanne Committee for World Evangelization, wrote an article titled &quot;By the year 2000, is God trying to tell us Something?&quot; that led to GCOWE I and launched the AD2000 &amp; Beyond Movement. The picture of a river reminds us that many have gone before us. We flow in the tradition of Berlin 1966 and wholeheartedly share this day its aim of the proclamation of the gospel throughout the world with the very same time target. The Berlin &#39;66 call was to proclaim the gospel within a generation; as a generation is 40 years or so, they were calling for the proclamation of the gospel by the year 2000 or just beyond. We flow in the spirit of the Lausanne I gathering in 1974 with nearly 2500 participants from 150 countries, and share wholeheartedly its goals: to impart a vision and a sense of responsibility for evangelism both locally and globally, to inform people of successful methods and tools, to facilitate evangelical cooperation in evangelism and to identify unevangelized areas. Another significant stream in on our movement was the Edinburgh &#39;80 global gathering of mission executives in 1980 with the theme of a church for every people by the year 2000. GCOWE &#39;89 in Singapore Through a survey done in preparation for GCOWE &#39;89, it became clear that the greatest obstacle to world evangelization by the year 2000 is lack of vision. Thus, according to this survey, the greatest single factor contributing to the fulfillment of the Great Commission is the development and sharing of vision. Any emerging movement was being called to share the vision and communicate what the Holy Spirit is doing through the body of Christ throughout the world. The first GCOWE consultation was held in Singapore in January 1989 with more than 300 participants from 50 countries with the declared purpose of: Accelerating the growing interest, attention, momentum and prayer in the body of Christ with regards to world evangelization, Promoting mutual encouragement and exchange of information among denominations and agencies who are planning for world evangelization by AD 2000; Promoting cooperative efforts in world evangelization among those planning around the milestone of AD 2000 and focusing on the minimally reached. Though the GCOWE &#39;89 steering committee dissolved, this event flowed into the AD 2000 &amp; Beyond Movement in a number of ways. For example, the Great Commission Manifesto produced in that meeting was unanimously approved with a specific focus--to provide every people and population on earth with a valid opportunity to hear the Gospel in a language they can understand, and to establish a mission -minded church planting movement within every unreached people group, so that the Gospel is accessible to all people. This became the the foundation for the development of our vision of a church for every people and the gospel for every person by the year 2000. Lausanne II in Manila, July &#39;89 Another significant stream flowing into our movement was Lausanne II in Manila in July 1989 with the call to &quot;Proclaim Christ Until He Comes.&quot; An important question was written in the Manila Manifesto endorsed by all participants: &quot;Now the year 2000 has become for many a challenging milestone. Can we commit ourselves to evangelize the world during the last decade of this millennium? There is nothing magical about the date, yet should we not do our best to reach this goal? Christ commands us to take the gospel to all people. The task is urgent. We are determined to obey Him with joy and hope.&quot; It was at that meeting following the plenary session on AD 2000 that a significant group of people met together and almost unanimously called for the establishment of a group to carry forward the AD 2000 vision. This has been done, pressed forward by countrywide initiatives to the year 2000. And so the AD 2000 &amp; Beyond Movement was born with a sense of destiny to take up the torch for a specific focus for this unique God-filled decade. The First Five Years of the Decade The first five years of the decade were years of seeding the clouds with the vision of a church for every people and the gospel for every person by the year 2000.... in the hope that the rain of God&#39;s blessing would come upon all flesh. This involved the building of a new kind of partnering relationship, a &quot;grassroots networking structure,&quot; a &quot;grassroots movement, a network of networks, a fusion of visions&quot; in which &quot;we are all controlled from the bottom up rather than from the top down.&quot; with a &quot;...focus on catalyzing, mobilizing, multiplying resources, through networks.&quot; The stated purpose was to &quot;encourage cooperation among existing churches, movements, and entities to work together toward the vision of a church for every people and the gospel for every person by the year 2000. Ten global functional networks and several task forces emerged that served as the building blocks upon which the movement flourished, with common a common focus on mobilizing global prayer for the 10/40 Window and empowering national AD2000 initiatives worldwide. Several words summarized the common commitment of the people drawn in to the national and global initiatives related to the AD 2000 &amp; Beyond Movement: &quot;mobilization,&quot; referring to the awakening of the church in every country of the world to find their place in the task of national and world evangelization; &quot;empowerment,&quot; which underscores the fact that the Lord has provided not only technological tools but mainly his own Spirit, to empower his people in the task of evangelization; &quot;penetration,&quot; which suggests the targeting of spiritual ministry primarily on the unfinished task of planting the church where there is none and proclaiming the gospel to every person; &quot;compassion,&quot; which reflects the concern for the whole person and the need to minister as servants; &quot;collaboration,&quot; which expresses the need to network and to work together to share Christ&#39;s love; &quot;intensification,&quot; underscores the urgency of the hour as we move to the milestone date, AD 2000; &quot;fulfillment&quot; which expresses the conviction that, yes, it is possible to bring the gospel to all people by the year 2000. Was this goal merely fluff and pie in the sky or not? That question required a midcourse evaluation. GCOWE &#39;95-a Mid-decadal Assessment Momentum increased as a result of GCOWE &#39;95 that brought together some 4000 Christian leaders from 186 countries of the world. Since each delegate was expected to raise their own travel costs, the vision was grass rooted. More than 70% of the funding came from Africa, Asia and Latin America. With this conference, the two-thirds world demonstrated its full partnership, if not primary initiative, in the cause of world evangelization. In their role as host the Korean church has become mainstream. Not only did the Korean church take up the largest share of any country on earth but they were the first to financially support and commit to the primary global thrust flowing out of GCOWE &#39;95-Joshua Project 2000. In fact, this North East Asia Joshua Project 2000 consultation is the first major gathering of many country and regional consultations being held around the world of this nature. We came together around a vision created in us by the command of Christ, to &quot;make disciples of all nations&quot; (Matthew 28:19) and to &quot;preach the Gospel to every creature&quot; (Mark 16:15). Our concern is for the whole church to take the whole Gospel to the whole world. Our primary but not exclusive focus is on the &quot;10/40 Window&quot; (the area of ten to forty degrees North of the equator from West Africa to East Asia) where most of the unreached people groups are located. There also we find the greatest degrees of poverty, illiteracy, disease and suffering. Seven reasons were given why we should work toward the goal of a church for every people and the gospel for every person, with faith that we could see it occur by December 31, 2000. Because the Word of God says it. Jesus said: &quot;I will build my church and Gates of Hell will not overcome it.&quot; (Mat. 16:18) &quot;I looked and there before me was a great multitude that no one could count, from every nation, tribe, people and language, standing before the throne and in front of the Lamb.&quot; (Rev. 7:9) )&quot;For the earth will be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the LORD, as the waters cover the sea.&quot; (Hab. 2:14) Because a great portion of the unfinished task has already been done. Current expectations state that by the year 2000, 99% of the population of the world- people from every culture and language and country-will have access to the gospel through a full or portion of Scripture in their own language, literature distribution, radio transmission, audio recordings, through the Jesus Film or through the preaching of an evangelist. By one means or another the world will be exposed to the gospel. In fact, it is not an &quot;either, or&quot; matter of accessibility to the gospel but &quot;both, and.&quot; What remains is but a small portion. But the evidence continues far beyond merely the extent of what&#39;s already been accomplished. Because of the rapid acceleration of divine activity toward the fulfillment of this goal. There is a divine superintending of global events, such as the demise of communism and the failure of secular humanism to satisfy the needs of man that suggest that we are moving from an age of unbelief to an age of faith as we approach the year 2000. Secular futurists tell us this. The secular press tells us this. Through His people, God is accomplishing the task more quickly than ever before. Patrick Johnstone, Chairman of the Unreached Peoples Network, assesses both aspects of the goal of a church for every people and the gospel for every person by the year 2000 when he writes: &quot;There is cause for much praise to God in progress over the past 200 years, and more especially in the past 30 and cautious hope for the initial attainment of our goals.&quot; Because of a global Great Awakening related to a prayer movement as we approach the year 2000, greatly surpassing anything in all of Christian history, evidenced by the growing momentum of mass prayer initiatives worldwide. Even though we do not all agree on how we should pray we do agree that indeed we should pray. From the many promises of God&#39;s Word in relation to answered prayer an accelerator of divine initiative is likely the growing prayer movement concentrating on world evangelization. We have watched in awe as God has moved through prayer initiatives such as the Day to Change the World held the 25th of June, 1994 with marches for Jesus in 170 countries and the October 1993 and October 1995 Praying Through the Window emphasis. Because the explosive growth of the Two Thirds World church in this century has positioned the church around the world for a major evangelistic thrust in the nineties. John Stott said it this way: it can be attained &quot;not least because of the proliferation of indigenous missions in Africa, Latin America, and the Pacific rim of East Asia. These may under God take the Gospel to the ends of the earth.&quot; Because God has endowed the church with the spiritual manpower, material resources and technology to complete the task of world evangelization. The critical issue is the deployment of these resources amongst the least evangelized. The technology exists today to both empower communication for cooperation &quot;within&quot; the Body and to penetrate every geographic and political barrier. Satellite delivery of TV signals is now worldwide. Because of genuine partnerships and open cooperation that are happening as never before. It is now recognized that this is the best way to take advantage of the opportunities presented by this last decade of the millennium. Many church and mission leaders now believe that genuine collaborative partnerships are the only way to take advantage of the opportunities presented by the last five years of this millennium. We believe that this is what God intends! The question became how we would work toward a final push in the next five years. In consultation with the AD2000 &amp; Beyond Movement network and task force leaders, a document was prepared for national and regional leaders from 186 countries of the world called Possible Outcomes of GCOWE 95 to Fulfill the Unfinished Task by December 31, 2000. In a number of sessions the document was reviewed. Follow-up resulted in a proposal to AD2000 leaders to consider building their next five years of work on two specific efforts, the AD2000 National Initiatives and Joshua Project 2000, empowered through the networks, task forces and ministries related to the Movement. The Launch of Joshua Project 2000 and the Last Five Years of the Decade Christian leaders from 77 countries met in a seven day conference held November 28 - December 2, 1995 in Colorado Springs to launch a five-year final thrust of the AD2000 &amp; Beyond Movement with the backbone of 1. National AD2000 Initiatives and 2. Joshua Project 2000-A priority global focus on the least evangelized peoples. Both thrusts will be empowered by the AD2000 resource networks and task forces with the result that there may be a church for every people and the gospel for every person by December 31, 2000. Through these networks and task forces and as a result of the effort to plant of a church for every people we would aim at accomplishing the goal of the gospel for every person by the year 2000. It was the conviction of participants at the &quot;Launch,&quot; that through Joshua Project 2000 the almost 2000 least evangelized peoples of the world would have a church planting movement initiated by the year 2000. The initial goal of Joshua Project 2000 is to establish , as a minimum, a pioneer church-planting movement resulting in 100 or more believing Christians in one or more reproducing churches within every ethno-linguistic people of over 10,000 individual. Our hope is that through the AD2000 national initiatives, both the Joshua Project 2000 peoples and the unreached peoples less than 10,000 in number would have a church by the year 2000. Joshua Project 2000, a five-year plan proposed by AD2000 and Beyond leaders, seeks to involve the participating AD2000 and Beyond networks, found in 160 nations, to work together to establish churches among these peoples. Under the plan, churches and agencies will send research and prayer teams to each of the listed groups to lay preliminary groundwork for evangelism and church-planting. A Conclusion We believe that all in the AD2000 &amp; Beyond Movement are servant-catalysts, seeking to encourage, motivate and network men and women church leaders by inspiring them with the vision of reaching the unreached by the year 2000 through consultations, prayer efforts and communication materials. This is being done by means of the primary efforts of the movement engaging in the development of National AD2000 Initiatives and with a priority global focus on the remaining approximately 1800 least evangelized peoples with more than 10, 000 individuals each, through Joshua Project 2000. We believe that God will continue to perform miracles to open the hearts of the lost; if the Body of Christ will rise to the challenge, the expected result is the establishment of a mission-minded church planting movement within every ethnolinguistic people by AD 2000, so that every person might have a valid opportunity to experience the love, truth and saving power of Jesus Christ in fellowship with other believers. We see the turn of the millennium as a unique occasion to reemphasize the urgency of taking the Gospel to the ends of the earth. The year 2000 can serve as a milestone to mark the advance of the Gospel, both as a focal point for intensified evangelistic work and a transition to a new century of missionary outreach.

    "title": "What is Joshua Project 2000?",
    "content": "What is Joshua Project 2000? Joshua Project 2000 is a global cooperative strategy, focused on the least evangelized peoples of the world. It seeks to engage every church, agency, denomination &amp; Christian from every country in the world in an effort to implement the goal of &quot;A church for every people and the gospel for every person by AD2000.&quot; Joshua Project 2000 is global. In a dramatic moment at the Global Consultation on World Evangelization (GCOWE) in Seoul in May 1995, one of the forty praying children from around the world tossed a round pillow with a world sewn onto it to another one of the children and shouted, &quot;Be global!&quot; A few weeks later more than 10,000 Korean children took the challenge seriously and met at the Olympic Stadium to pray for the nations of the world. Joshua Project 2000 is for the individual, who is or aspires to be, a world Christian. It is for the local church, with a global focus to accompany its local focus. Within the AD2000 and Beyond Movement, Joshua Project 2000 is the complementary global strategy to the nation-by-nation &quot;five-year strategy.&quot; These national strategies being developed in country after country all over the world are designed to foster national evangelization movements reaching their country and the world for Christ by the year 2000. Joshua Project 2000 is cooperative It recognizes that no one Christian, that no one church, no one denomination, no one agency or organization can do it alone. We need one another. Joshua Project 2000 is a strategy. Joshua Project 2000 is a strategy that seeks to obey the Great Commission and the commandment of Jesus to His followers by going to &quot;make disciples of all nations&quot; (Matt. 28:19). Specifically, the goal is to establish, at a minimum, a pioneer church-planting movement among every people (or ethne). The church- planting movements will fulfill the Lord&#39;s call to &quot;love your neighbor as yourself&quot; (Luke 10:27) and to &quot;preach good news to the poor ... to proclaim freedom for the prisoners and recovery of sight for the blind, to release the oppressed&quot; (Luke 4:18). Joshua Project 2000 is focused on the least- evangelized peoples of the world. At the heart of Joshua Project 2000 is a list of currently approximately 1,700 peoples that mission researchers have agreed upon as most needing a church-planting effort. Of these 1,700 peoples, numbering 2.2 billion people, nearly 90 percent of the individuals live in the 10/40 Window. The 10/40 Window is the rectangular area from West Africa to East Asia, identified by the latitudes that border it (10 N to 40 N). If we are to follow the example of Jesus who came &quot;to seek and to save what was lost&quot; (Luke 19:10) and who proclaimed that message to the poor (Luke 4:18), our primary concern will be the 10/40 Window where 99 percent of the world&#39;s least- evangelized poor can be found. Joshua Project 2000 seeks to engage every church, agency, denomination and Christian from every country in the world. Because the AD2000 vision of a church for every people (Matt. 28:19) and the gospel for every person (Mark 16:15) was given to every follower of Jesus, each church, agency and denomination is encouraged to make their contribution and become involved. Today, this is happening for the first time in history. Christians representing all continents and countries are getting involved. Joshua Project 2000 seeks to implement the goal of &quot;A church for every people and the gospel for every person by AD 2000.&quot; Christian statesman John Stott wrote recently, &quot;It has been statistically demonstrated that world evangelization in these terms is attainable, not least because of the proliferation of indigenous missions in Africa, Latin America, and the Pacific rim of East Asia.&quot; Why call it Joshua Project 2000? The AD2000 and Beyond Movement is transitioning from vision sharing to mobilization, just as in the Scriptural models of the Exodus and of Joshua. In the first five years of the 1990s, the AD2000 emphasis has been on casting a vision: a vision for the 10/40 Window, for national evangelization movements, and the ultimate goal of a church for every people and the gospel for every person. The second half of the decade brings a transition to an emphasis on mobilization. This change in emphasis is supported by three vital truths observed from the Biblical account of the Exodus. Vital Truth One--The principle of a spiritual movement. The Exodus was a divinely initiated movement. This was a spiritual movement: from slavery, to salvation, to service. The prayerful intent of the AD2000 and Beyond Movement is to cooperate with what the Holy Spirit is doing in our time through the mobilization of His people. Vital Truth Two--The principle of consultation of the Body of Christ. In the account of the movement of God&#39;s people at the time of the Exodus, prior to his charge to Pharaoh to let God&#39;s people go, Moses consulted first with Aaron and then with the elders and the rest of God&#39;s people. Recently, more than 100 consultations were held leading up to the GCOWE &#39;95 to discover what God is saying to His people: what are the contextual realities and the obstacles? What will it take to accomplish the goals for each country and the overall goal of a church for every people and the gospel for every person? Vital Truth Three--The principle of indigenization. The vision must be born of the Holy Spirit within the spiritual leaders of a local national church or a mission agency, or a country, as in the case of Moses and Aaron for the nation Israel. It needs to be a grassroots vision, owned by God&#39;s people. Thus, it was so encouraging to note that 70 percent of the funds for GCOWE &#39;95 came from Africa, Asia and Latin America, regions which have taken up the vision along with many in the West. Joshua Project 2000 has three strategies from the book of Joshua. Let us explore the land. The first time the Promised Land was explored, Moses sent spies. Joshua tells his version of the story in Joshua 14:6-12. The spies did on-site research, going over at the proper time: during the time of the harvest. They took great personal risks to accomplish the Kingdom work of possessing the land that had been promised to them. We also need to discover the opportunities God is creating among the least-evangelized peoples of the world. We also have &quot;fields white unto harvest&quot; (John 4:35). A majority report was given the first time the Promised Land was explored. It was wrong. All of God&#39;s people suffered as a result. Not only did they have to wander in the desert for forty years, every one of them died in the desert. Everyone that is, except for Joshua and Caleb, who gave the minority, but accurate, report. Many today are questioning the call to work together as God&#39;s people toward the goal of a church for every people and the gospel for every person: Is it hope or hype? Our call is to be bold and courageous -- to have hope and be responsive and obedient and to take the land! Let us pray that the walls come down. Joshua depended upon the miraculous intervention of the Lord to overcome his enemies. As with many cities today, Jericho was fortified and firmly entrenched by the enemy. Today, we are praying for the cities the Lord wants to take. In October &#39;95, millions prayed for the 100 Gateway Cities. In October &#39;97, we will be praying for the peoples most needing pioneer church-planting efforts. Much like when the physical walls of Jericho came tumbling down, we have seen the wall of Communism that separated the East from the West, a wall which formed an iron curtain, come crashing down. Through the prayers of God&#39;s people throughout the world, the anticipation is that other walls so resistant to Christianity will crumble, as those within the walls recognize how much God loves them in sending His son Jesus to die for them. Let us advance to offer the greatest of all gifts, Jesus Christ, to the peoples and the cities that most need Him. As each tribe of Israel had a position from which to advance, so each church and ministry today has a corporate giftedness to offer in this coordinated, systematic, step-by step advance to take the land. Why can Joshua Project 2000 succeed? Looking at the advance of the gospel, the great portion of the task has already been done. Current projections state that by the year 2000, more than 95 percent of the population of the world--people from every culture and language and country--will have access to the gospel through some portion of Scripture in their language, through literature distribution, radio transmission, audio recordings, the JESUS film or simply through the message of an evangelist. By one means or another they will have access to the gospel. When we examine the feasibility of planting a church for every people, we again see that a great portion of the task has already been done. Of the 12,000 known ethno-linguistic peoples in the world, 10,000 already have a church-planting movement in their midst. In every category, both exposure and response to the gospel (measured in terms of churches planted among the peoples) have been accelerating over the last 100 years, even more in the last 50 years, and most dramatically in the last 10 years. That is not to underestimate in any way the tremendous task ahead and the price that will need to be paid. Today we have a target list of least-evangelized peoples that is being revised each year to reflect greater accuracy. The 100 largest of these peoples are shown on the map on my first page and represent almost two billion people-- more than 80 percent of the individuals among the Joshua Project 2000 peoples. What are the major foundation stones of Joshua Project 2000? What we learned from one another at GCOWE &#39;95 as 4,000 Christian leaders from 186 countries met is that prayer, reconciliation and partnership are foundational in seeking to fulfill Jesus&#39; mandate, along with compassionate servanthood and empowerment as we are engaged and called to mobilize the body of Christ. We must repent and be reconciled. To reach the remaining unreached peoples we must be reconciled to our neighbors and other countries where hurt has occurred in the past. We are instructed by Jesus to leave our gift at the altar, to &quot;First go and be reconciled to your brother; then come and offer your gift&quot; (Matt. 5:24). As one participant reported at the gathering in Seoul, &quot;The Lord answered prayer! In the plenary, regional, country and special interest meetings, agendas were set aside as reconciliation broke out among delegates like holy fire. Japanese knelt before Koreans, Arab Christians embraced Jewish Christians, American leaders asked forgiveness of Canadian leaders, Russian Orthodox believers apologized to evangelicals and Pentecostals of the former Soviet Union.&quot; We must partner. Dr. Avery Willis spoke on behalf of the Southern Baptist denomination to the representatives of 186 countries in Seoul, saying, &quot;We want to ask forgiveness from you for thinking we could do this kind of job without you. We recognize that it is going to take the whole body of Christ to reach the people of this world.&quot; In making this statement, he spoke on behalf of so many churches, denominations, agencies and countries. We must demonstrate the love of Christ. As we serve the enormous human suffering in the least- evangelized peoples and cities we need to &quot;offer a cup of water&quot; in the name of the Lord, thereby demonstrating the love, joy and transforming power of Jesus Christ in deed as well as in word. As stated in the Great Commission Manifesto at GCOWE &#39;89: &quot;God&#39;s love brings hope to those who live under the bondage of sin, and who are victims of poverty and injustice. We believe that Christians involved in world evangelization should live among people as servants and minister to the needs of the whole person.&quot; What groups are being mobilized for Joshua Project 2000? Students are responding to the challenge. In the beginning of the last century a Student Volunteer Movement swept churches in the West into a global mission wave that brought spiritual refreshing on the people of that day. Today, 100 years later, a student volunteer movement beginning in the non-Western world promises to sweep across churches throughout the world to engage them in serious missions outreach to the remaining least-evangelized peoples of the world. On May 20, 1995, a steady rainfall in Seoul left many in doubt as to whether there would be a significant attendance for the student rally for missions at the Olympic Stadium. That evening, despite continued rainfall, doubts vanished as some 70,000 students filled the stadium. That night they were serious in their commitments. Sixty thousand students signed the declaration which included a willingness to: 1) devote one year of their lives to establish the church in a foreign land, and 2) mobilize other students in universities throughout the world. In both Brazil and South Africa, approximately 50,000 students are scheduled to meet for similar mobilization rallies for global missions over the next two years. Local churches are heeding the call. What joy the River of Life congregation in Kansas have experienced in adopting the Nakhi people from the Yunnan Province near the Tibetan border in China. Expectations are high in sending an on-site prayer team. The body of believers are committed to fielding an on-site research team. The church plans to offer support for a couple to go through a training process with a capable mission agency. There are even plans for the pastor and his wife to go in a year&#39;s time. The River of Life congregation has faith that reproducing fellowships will be established among the Nakhi people by the year 2000. What a model of adoption! AD2000 Networks &amp; Christian Organizations are making big plans. As a part of Joshua Project 2000, Every Home for Christ is working in conjunction with various member organizations of the AD2000 God&#39;s Word and Literature Network (as well as with CBN International and Campus Crusade for Christ&#39;s JESUS film project). Every Home is setting one of its most ambitious goals in its fifty-year history: to reach one billion of these unreached people right where they live through house-to house evangelism by the year 2000. See &quot;Joshua Project 2000 Step 3: Researching On-Site and Preparing the Way for Church Planting&quot; for details about what this AD2000 Network and others are doing. C. Peter Wagner, Coordinator of the AD2000 United Prayer Network writes, &quot;We will be praying for the profiles that are needed for Joshua Project 2000. Among other things, it is our goal to recruit at least 20,000 local churches plus 20,000 home cell groups which will commit to pray for a specific people group through 2000 AD.&quot; Find out more and learn about Praying Through the Window III under &quot;Joshua Project 2000 Step 5: Praying for the Least-Evangelized Peoples.&quot; Mission Agencies promise to play a role. Fred Markert of Youth With a Mission (YWAM) Strategic Frontiers, USA, reported of their plans to &quot;challenge... 70 YWAM bases in North America to send out at least two Joshua Project 2000 teams within the next year.... [and] challenge those who return from a Joshua Project 2000 team to return... as long- term church planters or to become full-time mobilizers on the homefront for those people groups.&quot; Greg Livingstone of Frontiers said that organization is willing &quot;to host research teams for Joshua Project 2000 coming to the Muslim cities where we have workers.&quot; Orville Fletcher of Pioneers pledges that they will &quot;assist... in reaching the unreached peoples in any way we can.&quot; What will be your involvement in Joshua Project 2000? As International Director of the AD2000 and Beyond Movement, I stand in awe of what I see God doing in these exciting years leading up to the year 2000. I serve a movement that has now spread to almost every country on the earth. Now it is our prayerful desire to see this move of God in each of the peoples of the world. We need your help. The people at the U.S. Center for World Mission have graciously allowed us this entire edition of Mission Frontiers to try to communicate to you what God is doing through Joshua Project 2000. Pray as you read through these pages what your role might be and then fill out the enclosed response form. I eagerly await your response. Outquotes Joshua Project 2000 Assurance --God promised to Joshua: &quot;I will give you every place where you set your foot&quot; (Joshua 1:3). Thus, we believe that there will be Christians &quot;standing before the throne from every nation, tribe, people and language&quot; crying &quot;...Salvation.&quot; This is guaranteed. It&#39;s in the Book. Joshua Project 2000 Goal: to make a priority of establishing, as a minimum, a pioneer church planting movement within every ethno- linguistic people of over 10,000 individuals within every country of the world by December 31, 2000. Missions mobilization has been defined as any event by which God&#39;s people are awakened and kept moving until they find their place for personal involvement in the task of completing world evangelization.

    "content": "GCOWE &#39;95: Welcoming Address Luis Bush My name is Luis Bush. I am the International Director of GCOWE &#39;95. [Welcome in the languages of the consultation] There are probably participants from more countries of the world at this Christian gathering than at any other event at any time in all of Christian history. Praise the Lord. We are grateful for the hospitality of the Korean church. Let us test our Korean together. Can you say &quot;Kum sum ni da&quot;? Probably many of us are amazed that we are even here. For the last six weeks I have been recovering from a hernia surgery, limited to not lift anything over ten pounds. I have felt like I have had a flat tire. At times my faith wavered looking at the magnitude of the financial obligation. My wife Doris one time said to me: &quot;You are acting like a little boy who wants what he wants right away.&quot; Many of you have struggled even upon arriving. For all of the inconveniences and miscommunications I take full responsibility. I would ask your forgiveness and on behalf of all of us who have not treated you properly I ask your forgiveness. I do believe that God wants us to come to this meeting with a spirit of brokenness. As we meet in this Torch Center I am reminded of Gideon&#39;s small band being called upon by God to carry the torch in the left hand concealed by an earthen vessel. For the light to shine through, the vessel had to be broken. For the light to shine out from this Torch Center and GCOWE from all the nations gathered here I believe that the earthen vessel must be broken. We must be broken. Perhaps all of the inconveniences, missionary style housing for most everybody here, can be used to prepare us for the light to shine forth from this place to our Jerusalems our Samarias and to the uttermost parts of the world. As Paul the Apostle says in II Cor 4:7: &quot;We have this treasure in these earthen vessels (these jars of clay) to show that this all-surpassing power is from God and not from us.&quot; Our purpose in GCOWE &#39;95 is to encourage continued momentum building toward the fulfillment of the goal of a church for every people and the gospel for every person by the year 2000. As we move through the plenary sessions I appeal to your understanding. We wish to respect every speaker who deserves much more time than they have. On the other hand all of you have come a long way at great expense so we wish to respect your time. The Program Production Committee, keeping all this in view has prepared a program that we believe will help us all toward our objective here at GCOWE. Therefore we are asking each speaker to keep within the allotted time. To ensure that this will indeed happen the Program Production Committee has developed their own strategy. With one minute left to complete the time allotted Frank Fortunato will start with one minute of soft music. The music will grow louder. With no time left the lights will dim and the next speaker begin to come on. It the speaker continues the sound at the microphone will go off. We are gathered here with the rich heritage of those who have gone before us. We are here in a spirit of repentance... repenting for our lack of heart, vision, our lack of compassion, our bigotry, our prejudice. Yet grateful for the blood of Jesus that cleanses us from all of our sin. Thankful for the power of Jesus that enables us to go on. Grateful for the those who have gone before. We meet in the tradition of Berlin 1966 and wholeheartedly share this day its aim of the proclamation of the gospel throughout the world with the very same time target. The Berlin &#39;66 call was to proclaim the gospel within a generation; as a generation is 40 years or so, they were calling for the proclamation of the gospel by the year 2000 or just beyond. We are indebted to the Lausanne I gathering in 1974 with nearly 2500 participants from 150 countries, and share wholeheartedly its goals even as we meet now at GCOWE &#39;95: to impart a vision and a sense of responsibility for evangelism both locally and globally, to inform people of successful methods and tools, to facilitate evangelical cooperation in evangelism and to identify unevangelized areas. We wholeheartedly follow in the footsteps of the theme and vision of Lausanne II in Manila 1989 with the call to &quot;Proclaim Christ Until He Comes.&quot; It was at that meeting following the plenary session on AD 2000 that a significant group of people met together and almost unanimously called for the establishment of a group to carry forward the AD 2000 vision. This has been done, pressed forward by countrywide initiatives to the year 2000 with some 2000 individual plans of evangelism directed to the year 2000. And so we are committed to take up the torch for this special God-filled decade of evangelism... a decade of harvest, a decade of Holy Spirit anointing, a decade of great expectations. We have been criticized of reductionism -- i.e. reducing the gospel and its implications to a time frame, to measurable objectives. However, we embrace the Lausanne covenant and proclaim a whole gospel -- not a truncated gospel, but the gospel with all of its demands, the gospel with the fruit of repentance. We embrace the Great Commission Manifesto, drafted at GCOWE &#39;89 in Singapore, which states so clearly: &quot;The Good News of Jesus Christ brings special meaning to suffering humanity. God&#39;s love brings hope to those who live under the bondage of sin, and who are victims of poverty and injustice. We believe that Christians involved in world evangelization should live among people as servants and minister to the needs of the whole person.&quot; In fact, the primary though not exclusive focus of the AD 2000 &amp; Beyond Movement is on the 10/40 Window, precisely because it is where humanity suffers more than any other region in the earth; whether it is spiritual suffering through ignorance of the gospel, human suffering due to oppression, human suffering due to poverty, human suffering due to infant mortality, human suffering due to early deaths, human suffering due to high rates of illiteracy, and human suffering due to the historic bondages and alliances made with Satan himself Through our purpose statement we seek to be servant-catalysts, seeking to encourage, motivate and network men and women church leaders by inspiring them with the vision of reaching the unreached by the year 2000 through consultations, prayer efforts and communication materials. The expected result is the establishment of a mission-minded church planting movement within every significantly large ethnolinguistic people by AD 2000, so that every person might have a valid opportunity to experience the love, truth and saving power of Jesus Christ in fellowship with other believers. What kind of church are we seeking to establish? -- not a mutilated church, but rather, as it says in the very last statement of the Great Commission Manifesto: &quot;Establish a Christian community of worship, instruction in the word, healing, fellowship, prayer, disciple making, evangelism, and missionary concern in every human community,&quot; that Christ may become incarnate in all of His fullness, in all of who He is in each community. Do the advocates of social involvement have a home in AD 2000? They most certainly do. Can they have full citizenship in AD 2000? They are most welcome. However, this is not a conference to discuss the content of the gospel but how to communicate it. This is not a conference to discuss the nature of the church but how can we saturate the world with the church of our Lord so that the earth is full of His glory as the waters cover the sea. Our concern is getting that job done. Article source: http://www.ad2000.org/gcowe95/lbwelcom.html",

    "title": "GCOWE '95: Zaire Model",
    "content": "GCOWE &#39;95: The Zaire Model Dia Diafwila AD2000 Country Coordinator Director, Every Home for Christ Brief History, Work, Objectives and Progress Brief History Of All For Christ Movement &quot;All For Christ&quot; as a mission movement in Congo started in 1978 when the first Protestant missionaries came to our jungles with the Good News of Christ. All missions societies that came to Congo since then have had one goal: to reach all Congo means all tribes, classes and persons for Christ. This first stage of Evangelism and mission work in Congo included a clear proclamation of the Gospel and church planting among hidden people groups. The &quot;All For Christ&quot; mission movement gave birth to a local church in which many Protestant denominations have been working together for one purpose: to win all Zaire with Christ. During the Jubilee Conference of 1928, Protestant denominations of Congo were given the name of &quot;Eglise Indigene&quot; (Indigenous Church). During the Conference of 1934, mission church leaders decided to change the name to &quot;Church of Christ in Congo.&quot; All leaders were convinced that Christ has only one Church in the world with many diversities, so it was not necessary to build many denominations in Congo. The main objective of Christian mission in Congo was to build one Church in the heart of Africa: the &quot;Church of Christ.&quot; Christ is not physically, psychologically, or spiritually divided. He is one Body. So is also His Church in the earth. From 1934 to 1960, the Church of Christ in Congo had two main institutions: The &quot;Conseil Protestant du Congo&quot; (CPC), and the Church of Christ, as a Body with many local churches or parishes. Each denomination was a section of the Unity. It was very easy to build and realize church growth programs for all the nation. In February 1960, mission leaders of the CPC decided to transfer the leadership to Congolese. Pastor Joel Bulaya of Methodist was elected as the President, Pastor Daniel Mawanda of the Evangelical section, Vice President, Pastor Pierre Shaumba, General of Executive Secretary. This last leader was the man that God would use to start in 1966 a new revival that helped all leaders of the church to become a part of a great evangelistic movement called: &quot;Christ For All.&quot; Pastor Willys Braun, a missionary of CMA, was the technocrat of this movement, and Dr. Makanzu played the role of catalyst and animator. With the leadership of Pastor Makanzu, all denominations of the Church of Christ of Zaire opened a department of evangelism, mobilizing Christians to pray effectively and witness. Many new movements of evangelism and discipleship like Campus Crusade for Christ and Scripture Union opened their offices in Kinshasa and started working with the Church of Christ to help all Protestant and Catholic parishes learn more about prayer, evangelism, revival, and Church growth. From 1966 to 1976, the nation of Congo (becoming Zaire by the end of this decade) experienced a great revival. In each city, churches organized a March For Jesus each year with a great Crusade in the stadium. All University Institutions were saturated by the Gospel Evangelical Churches were created in all universities. Some scholars were converted and became pastors and evangelists. It was a great miracle because no educated man wished to become a pastor in 1960. From 1976 to 1986 was a time of great revival in the Catholic Church. Many Zaire church leaders went to the Amsterdam I and II meetings and were radically transformed by the call of the Lord to do the work of evangelism. Coming back home, they organized the third National Congress of Evangelism in April 1985. It was during this Congress that the decision of proclaiming again and again the Word of God was taken. The Church discovered that the task was not completed by missionaries and the first generation of pastors and evangelists. An International School of Evangelism, Christian Communication and Christian Education was opened by Willys Braun to help all the Body of Christ to train many as workers for the great harvest. In April 1990, a National Congress of Evangelism took place (just after Lausanne II in 1989) with the theme: &quot;Lift Up Your Eyes, and Look On The Fields; For They Are White Already To Harvest&quot; (John 4:35B). On the walls of the room, all participants could read: &quot;Lift Up Your Eyes And Look... Zaire AD2000.&quot; This was the historical start of the AD2000 Movement in Zaire because it was in this Congress that all Church leaders of evangelism were challenged to reach all people groups in Zaire. A map of pygmy groups was shown publicly and many evangelists became more aware of the unfinished task. At the end of this Congress it was decided to mobilize and train all the church to reach all the nation in a great, new concerted movement of the Holy Spirit. The Work of Zaire AD2000 In 1991, after a special workshop with John Robb in reaching unreached people, we built a program of evangelization among twelve tribes of people groups: Gbandi, Water people or Libinza, Bilangi (pygmy of Equatorial Forest), Batswa (pygmies of Equator, Bandundu and Kivu), Balumbe (pygmies who live near water), Basongye, Balunda, Banianga, Bahunde, Yaka Holo, Bawoyo, and Bakusu of Kinda. In building a program to reach these groups, the Church discovered the necessity of building a National AD2000 team, bringing together denominations and international para-church organizations. In January 1993, a National Consultation was organized under the supervision of Pastor Diafwila with more than 300 evangelists, pastors and layman and women. They decided to become part of a new and great evangelism and Church Growth National movement called: &quot;All For Christ by 2000.&quot; During this consultation, all participants worked together to build national programs for Prayer Mobilization, March for Jesus, Saturation Church planting, Unreached Peoples, Rural Evangelism with Portable Schools and &quot;every tree for Christ&quot;, Urban ministry, Mission, Research, Youth and Sports, Women Mobilization, Tent-maker Mobilization, and Literature Evangelism. The national coordinator has the charge of printing a national &quot;All for Christ&quot; program for 30,000 local churches each year. Since 1974, we have been establishing this document for mobilizing the Body of Christ, official and independent churches included. Church mobilization for prayer, evangelization and church planting national movement is the condition of the success of an AD2000 movement in a nation. It is why every year we have to print a booklet in which we briefly develop monthly Bible teaching on prayer, evangelization, mission church growth, unreached people groups, family evangelism, witnesses, building prayer and evangelistic teams, etc. In the field, denominations are using portable schools to train teachers how to teach the Bible to the newly converted. All denominations are using the national program booklets to train and help Christians, pastors and evangelism to reach the unreached and evangelize the non-evangelized. &quot;The Gospel to every person and the church for every people&quot; is becoming more and more real in Zaire. In Kinshasa, the capital city, many churches are now creating a new baby church or now have two or three Sunday services because of &quot;All for Christ&quot; evangelistic efforts. So, in Kinshasa, the Church of Christ parishes will soon double their number, from 650 local churches now to more than 1300 in 1997. Using the method of Every Home for Christ Family Crusade among pygmies, we planted 32 churches from 1993 to 1994. Now the 32 local churches have planted 300 new churches in the forest. A missionary pastor in Bosuka has planted a church of 4000 among the Bilangi of Bosuka in the virgin forest. Many Gbandi are coming to Jesus through home to home evangelism. In North and South Kivu, many peoples in which no one has ever preached the Gospel before are now receiving the gospel and becoming active members of new local churches. The strength of the AD2000 movement in Zaire is in the fact that it is rooted in local church communities across the nation. The task of national coordinators is only to mobilize, give the vision and train church leaders in Church mobilization for prayer, evangelism, discipleship and church planting. Later in 1995, in Kinshasa, we will organize an AD2000 consultation with all the denominational leaders in Zaire. Before this National Consultation for building a five year program from 1995 to 2000, we will have AD2000 workshops with all the representatives and evangelists of the evangelical churches in the country. The objective of this workshop will be to learn together how to pray, evangelize, plant churches in Zaire and send missionaries from Zaire before December 31, 2000. Our main objective is to double the number of churches and born again Christians by December 3, 2000. It will be done, by God&#39;s grace. Article source: http://www.ad2000.org/gcowe95/diaf.html",

    "title": "GCOWE '95 Wrap Up: Report by Brigada",
    "content": "GCOWE &#39;95 Wrap Up: Report by Brigada Doug Lucas GCOWE &#39;95 GCOWE 95 NOW HISTORY -- They came together from all over the world -- 186 nations to be exact. It was called the Global Consultation on World Evangelization -- and global is right! Our count revealed 3293 delegates plus a total of 827 guests, intercessors, staff and volunteers resulted in 4120 individuals gathered for one and only one purpose -- to glorify God and hasten the evangelization of the world in which we live. May 17-25 won&#39;t be soon forgotten, whether in Korea or in parts far flung. What themes will be remembered??? Among them will be ... Reconciliation -- Japanese with Koreans, Arabs with Jews, Russian Orthodox with evangelicals, denominations with other denominations. 10/40 Window -- From the sermons and presentations to the planning and even the singing... we won&#39;t forget the imaginary rectangle stretching from ten to forty degrees North of the equator, from West Africa to East Asia, where the greatest concentration of unevangelized people reside. Int&#39;l participation -- Not only were two-thirds of the participants from Africa, Latin America and Asia, but the majority of the consultation&#39;s funding came from those nations as well. Western missionaries took notes as African, Asian and Latin American leaders presented their successful methodology. They had become full partners in the task. Prayer -- At the great evangelical consultations (Lausanne I, Lausanne II in Manila, etc.), prayer has always been an ingredient. But some -- even the &quot;old-timers&quot; -- said they couldn&#39;t remember a time when prayer permeated every component so thoroughly. Who can forget the Cities Track closing, where Viv Grigg organized separate, targeted prayer for each region being reported on? Who will ever forget the Concert of Prayer during the plenary? Prayer in the hallways, prayer in the national meetings, prayer here, prayer there...... prayer as a major weapon or tool in our confrontation with the enemy. It was clear that prayer had finally &quot;arrived&quot; -- and was seen as a superior &quot;weapon&quot; in the international worker&#39;s tool box, along with less powerful tactical strategies or scientific church growth approaches. Networking -- Some said that the most valuable times came not during a main plenary session, or even the tracks, but rather in the hallways, over the dining tables, and on the buses, where international workers from around the world met up with mutually helpful contributors from continents around the globe. Promise -- From all the media accounts and reports from the International Office, you&#39;d think this would be the consultation to end all consultations! Well it just might be! As strategies are completed and partnerships gel, God just might raise up international forces that would reach parts of our world that have never been reached before. For another related perspective, check out this letter from missions author and statesman, Leonard Tuggy, sent to Brigada during GCOWE 95: When we were serving in the Philippines some years ago, we learned what I felt was an important lesson by observing the results of two programs which had contrasting philosophies. The first program was the &quot;Christ the Only Way&quot; movement, which was a saturation evangelism strategy to reach the Philippines for Christ. A well-known parachurch organization sponsored this program for several years and sought to enlist churches, denominations and missions to come aboard and adopt the strategy that they laid out for all of us. There was fruit from this effort, but in the end there was some disappointment with the results. The second program, which came along a few years later, was the Discipling A Whole Nation (DAWN) program, led by Jim Montgomery (who had also worked in the first program). I remember well joining Jim and Dr. McGavran in a series of conferences in the Philippines, launching this program in 1980. The difference in this program was that it was an effort to enlist as many churches, denominations and missions as possible to commit themselves to the stated goal, which was &quot;a church in every barangay (village or district) by the year 2000.&quot; That would be a total of 50,000 churches. This program is still going on, and excellent progress has already been made in reaching the goal. Seminars were given in connection with DAWN instructing churches and groups how to set goals and develop strategies, but the actual work of doing these things was left to the churches, denominations and missions themselves. The result was a unity as far as the overall goal was concerned, and diversity as far as individual strategies were concerned. Thinking about this reminded me of the contrast between communism and capitalism in economic theory. Communism with its strong emphasis on centralized planning of the economy sounds so efficient, but it doesn&#39;t work, primarily because a large economy is so incredibly complex that centralized planning can&#39;t handle it. On the other hand, capitalism seems to be so &quot;messy,&quot; yet it seems to work with its singleminded goal of making a profit. Maybe the best thing that could come out of GCOWE would be a deep commitment of all involved to the goal of &quot;A church for every people by the year 2000,&quot; a better understanding of all that need to be done to accomplish this, and the establishing of networks of communication and cooperation to enable all participants to keep informed and focused on the goal until it is accomplished.

    "content": "GCOWE &#39;95: The United States Model Paul Cedar Chairman, International Coalition Coordinator, Denominational Track Chairman, Mission America 2000 &amp; U.S. Lausanne Committee As we approach the midpoint of this final decade of the Twentieth Century, the Lord of the Church has begun to stir in hearts of many Christian leaders in the United States. He is calling us to give spiritual leadership to the mobilizing of Christ&#39;s Church for united prayer, the seeking of genuine revival in the Church and authentic spiritual awakening in the nation and a united effort to share the Gospel of Christ with every man, woman, young person and child in the United States by the end of the millennium. In addition, we believe that God is desiring to use us in mobilizing tens of thousands of Christ&#39;s disciples to share the love and grace of our Lord Jesus Christ with scores of Unreached People Groups in the United States and around the world. In summary, our prayerful goal is mobilize &quot;the whole U.S. Church to take the whole gospel to the whole nation in this generation.&quot; -and then to mobilize thousands of new cross-cultural missionaries to team with brothers and sisters from other nations of the world in going to the unreached peoples of the world including the millions of unreached peoples residing in the 10/40 Window. This movement in the United States has begun to emerge clearly by the initiative and the orchestration of the Holy Spirit. The initial sign that our Lord is at work in our nation in the midst of a declining American culture has been the emergence of many grass roots prayer movements including the Concert of Prayer movement, Prayer Summits, denominational prayer initiatives, the growth of the National Day of Prayer activities, the March for Jesus movement, the &quot;Meet Me at the Pole&quot; youth prayer movement and the reintroduction of the National Prayer Accord. It was in this context of united prayer that God began to move in the hearts of several dozen Christian leaders some three years ago to begin to meet for prayerful conversations regarding what our Lord was saying to the American Church regarding revival, spiritual awakening concerted prayer, repentance, spiritual unity and cooperative evangelistic outreach to the United States and the world. In a most remarkable way, the Lord moved gently in bringing the U.S. Lausanne Committee to vote unanimously to adopt the AD 2000 &amp; Beyond agenda for the remainder of the decade. The U.S. Lausanne Committee ministries and the AD 2000 &amp; Beyond initiatives have been blended together by the Spirit of God in a wonderful way. We have moved ahead &quot;on our knees&quot; in attempting to be sensitive and obedient to the guidance of the Holy Spirit. In short, we have been committed deeply to proceed the &quot;Jesus Way&quot;-and not the well-known &quot;American Way.&quot; The result has been the emergence of Mission America 2000. Our gracious Lord has brought into being a grass-roots movement initiated and orchestrated by the Holy Spirit comprised of increasing numbers of local churches, denominations, Christian institutions and para-church ministries. This coalition of ministries and ministry networks has unprecedented potential for united evangelistic outreach in the United States and beyond. Needless to say, this is a very crucial and strategic time for the continued emergence and development of this ministry coalition. We need your prayers! Like other AD 2000 &amp; Beyond initiatives in many nations of the world, our Lord has led us clearly to focus upon a city and area strategy. We have discovered that some 216 major media markets encompass 100 per cent of the population of the United States. Therefore, we envision at least 216 local or area committees being formed in order to be able to minister to every person in the United States. And because the population is so vast in some of those 216 markets, we envision scores of cities within the major markets forming local committees. At present, we estimate that MA 2000 will be comprised of at least 300 local committees throughout the United States. At present, we are aware of some 60 city committees in some stage of formation. I would emphasize the fact that most of these committees have been formed spontaneously simply by the prompting of the Holy Spirit in a given city. Most such committees have not even been aware that other cities were involved in doing the same. Only in recent months have many of these committees become a part of the national MA 2000 coalition. This is truly a &quot;grass roots&quot; movement brought into being by our Lord Jesus Christ. Secondly, there been the formation of a number of Resource Ministry Tracks or Strategic Alliances. At present, some 20 Resource Ministry Tracks are either functioning or are in the process of formation. Two of the Resource Ministry Tracks have full-time coordinators while others are served by volunteer leadership. It is our intention to be open to the guidance and provision of the Holy Spirit to embrace and encourage as many Resource Ministry Tracks that our Lord brings into existence for strategic ministry. The major purpose of the tracks will be to serve as strategic ministry resources to local and regional committees. In addition, some statewide and national ministries may be initiated such as a national church planting ministry. However, most implementation of such ministries will take place under the leadership of local MA 2000 committees. A third major element is being added to the MA 2000 strategy. Beginning in 1996, a national evangelistic outreach will take place annually which will focus upon a united strategy. For example, in 1996 we will focus upon a national Olympic Outreach led by the Sports Outreach America ministry coalition. Then, in 1997, we will attempt to share the Gospel with every person in United States through the Jesus Film video project. Although these annual national ministry strategies will be vitally important, they will not be exclusive. In other words, the local committees and Resource Ministry Tracks will simultaneously be carrying on their specific ministry agendas in addition to being involved in the annual national evangelistic initiatives. In summary, it is our prayerful objective to share the love and grace of Jesus Christ is some appropriate manner with every person in the United States during the remaining years of this decade, as our Lord tarries. At the same time, we will be inviting and encouraging the people of God to humble themselves and pray and turn to Christ with all of their hearts so that our gracious Lord will hear our prayers and heal our land by bringing genuine revival and spiritual awakening, so that millions of non-Christians and nominal Christians may become alive in Christ, so that unprecedented ministries of evangelism may take place in our nation, so that that tens of thousands of America&#39;s Christians may go to other nations of the world with the Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ. This is our prayer-in the name of Jesus. Brothers and sisters, please pray for us! Amen. Article source: http://www.ad2000.org/gcowe95/cedar.html",

    "content": "GCOWE &#39;95: The Pastor&#39;s Global Network John Richard Associate International Director of GCOWE &#39;95 Coordinator, AD2000 Pastor&#39;s Network Networking pastors from 200 countries around the world, this Network is committed to carrying out this five-fold purpose: To mobilize pastors so that their local churches/assemblies will engage in the work of evangelization, missions and church planting. To train our laity in the local church for the work of evangelization. To encourage pastors and leaders to prevail on the members of their local churches to testify publicly to the Head of the Church through varied forms of witness, including praise marches. To enable the Pastor to have a greater import of the grandeur and dignity of the ministry entrusted to him. To equip the Pastor with skills and tools that enhance the effectiveness of the ministry. Training our laity Writes a pastor from India, &quot;Our people need to believe and practice Ephesians 4:11-16. We also need to educate them that in order to be involved in the Lord&#39;s work and in the spreading of the gospel, one does not have to be a full-time missionary or evangelist. We all have to do the work of an evangelist wherever we are.... Since we are not able to bring people to our churches to give them the Gospel, we now need to take the Gospel to the market place, to our offices, schools, colleges, neighborhoods, shops, etc., We need to teach them creative means of sharing the Gospel and provide all the needed training and resources to do it.&quot; Our laity are our &quot;frozen asset&quot; who need to be &quot;defrosted.&quot; Moreover, if this world is ever to be evangelized, that can only be done by &quot;ordinary believers who scatter the Word of God.&quot; A questionnaire was circulated to over 460 pastors in different parts of the world. Among the 14 questions asked, there were those that sought answers to items such as current realities, likely trends, dreaming/vision, factors in favor or and against the fulfillment of the vision, setting up of priorities, long range plans, action plans and go forward structure. The responses revealed that a fair percentage of the churches have thought in terms of setting faith goals for AD2000. Among the rest of them there was awakened in them a desire to make similar plans and to work towards implementing the same. One area of weakness was the lack of facilities, personnel and other resources to disciple new converts. The responses also indicated that an effective church, especially in the economically deprived countries, cannot afford to ignore its social responsibility. This of course, is in keeping with the expected result as noted in the Purpose Statement of the AD2000 &amp; Beyond Movement, namely, &quot;the establishment of a mission-minded (not exclusively missions-minded) church-planting movement so that all peoples might have a valid opportunity to experience the love of Jesus Christ in fellowship with other believers.&quot; More importantly, the responses revealed that the concepts of unreached peoples and of the responsibility devolving on local churches to adopt these unreached peoples (so as to establish a mission-minded church-planting movement among them) is gaining ground. Concern for reaching countries and cities is also being evidenced in a greater measure than ever before. Indeed, the climate for furthering the vision of the AD2000 &amp; Beyond Movement, namely, a church for every people and the gospel for every person by AD2000, has never been more favorable than at present. Therefore, the Pastors Global Network, by enabling grace of God, will seek to do the following: To mobilize the resources of the local churches to whatever extent possible and to make these available to other agencies who are directing their efforts to reaching Affinity Blocs of Peoples, &quot;Gateway&quot; peoples and cities; To assist in developing a unified strategy of systematic and saturation evangelism to ensure that every person in every country will have the opportunity to hear or read the gospel in their own language or in a language that they can understand. More specifically, the Pastors&#39; Network will: Encourage Pastors to convene in their churches Consultations on the AD2000 vision; Encourage Pastors to form an AD2000 Task Force or Committee which will initiate selection and adoption of an unreached people group. This will involve obtaining its profile from agencies such as Adopt-A-People Clearing House, mobilizing prayer support on its behalf and challenging church members to go as missionaries and providing financial support for them. Also to challenge those with secular skills to serve as tentmakers among the adopted unreached people. Encourage Pastors to link up with fellow pastors in their neighborhood or city so as to spread the AD2000 vision through united prayer efforts and Praise Marches for Jesus. F. B. Meyer, that great English Baptist preacher once said, &quot;The Church which is not a missionary church will be a missing church when Jesus comes.&quot; The Pastors Network commits itself to partnering with other Networks in the AD2000 &amp; Beyond Movement and also with other agencies in seeing that the local churches of the world do not become missing bodies when Jesus comes.

    "content": "GCOWE &#39;95: Nigerian Model Reuben Ezemadu AD2000 National Co-Coordinator, Nigeria Chairman, Strategy &amp; Resource Dev. Task Force Chairman, Nigeria Evangelical Missions Assoc. During the 1989 National Consultation on the Evangelization of Nigeria by the year 2000, participants resolved as follows: &quot;We are committed to taking the gospel to every unreached people - so that every person in Nigeria could have a relevant opportunity to respond to the gospel of Jesus Christ.&quot; &quot;We accept the challenge to take the gospel to the underprivileged parts of Africa and the world in terms of resources, manpower, and mission efforts or possibilities. To this end, every denomination or ministry is encouraged to be mission-minded and missionary-sending.&quot; These were translated into a national goal of ensuring that at least 75% of the Nigerian population should have had opportunity to hear the gospel and declared their allegiance to Christ by the year 2000. A number of plans emerged from the denominations and ministries towards the realization of this goal. Annual review and strategic planning sessions have been held since 1989 to ensure that the plans are in course and that the goals set are pursued. Results: Significant among the outcomes of the above national initiative is the fact that there have been seventy (70) new entries into fifty (50) unreached people groups within and outside Nigeria between 1989 and 1994. Thirty five (35) of these unreached people groups fall within the 10/40 window. Missionaries from Nigerian Churches and Mission Agencies also account for one third of the estimated 12,829 protestant missionaries from Africa. The Nigeria Evangelical Missions Association has 36 mission agencies and denominational mission boards. Altogether, missionaries from Nigeria are working in about 30 countries within Africa and other continents, mostly in the 10/40 window. 1000 Action-Plans At the 1994 consultation on the Evangelization of Nigeria by the year 2000, the &quot;1000 Action-Plans&quot; adopted. Using the various resource networks and task forces as units, &quot;1000 actions&quot; were identified as necessary, if we are to achieve our AD2000 goal. The &quot;actions&quot; were distributed to the various resource networks and task forces. Each action depicted a particular step that could be taken to achieve the specific objectives of the resource networks and the general goal of the church. The actions focus on the unreached people groups. Churches and organisations are now encouraged to adopt one or more of the &quot;action-plans&quot; as their quota in the accomplishment of the national goal. Adoption and implementation of these &quot;action-plans&quot; are being coordinated and monitored by the AD2000 National Task Force. Future Expectations It is our sincere hope that by the time these &quot;action-plans&quot; are all adopted and strictly implemented, we shall have attained our goal of &quot;a church for every people group in Nigeria and the gospel to every Nigerian,&quot; in addition to contributing up to one third of the projected 10,000 missionaries expected to be raised in Africa by the year 2000.

    "content": "GCOWE &#39;95: New Zealand Denominational Initiative Bruce Patrick, New Zealand Chairman, VISION New Zealand Senior Pastor, Auckland Baptist Tabernacle Tena koutou katoa (Maori language = greetings to you all). It&#39;s a privilege to share how God has led us in New Zealand to a vision for greater cooperation among the denominations to reach our nation. New Zealand, in the South Pacific, is a western democracy of 3.5 million people. There are 60 million sheep. Our islands are similar in size to Great Britain. In the 1800s New Zealand was settled as a British colony. Through an amazing people movement the Holy Spirit swept most of the indigenous Maori people into the kingdom of God. New Zealand was churched by the transfer of Britain&#39;s major denominations: in order of size the largest groups are Anglican, Presbyterian, Roman Catholic, Methodist, Baptist. New Zealand has sent out possibly the highest number of missionaries per capita in the world. Our largest city, Auckland, has one million people. Our population is: 75% British or European origin, 12% Maori, 6% Pacific Islanders, 7% Asian. A dramatic recent religious trend has been the huge increase of people who claim to have no religion, to about 25% of our population. The historic mainline churches are losing many nominal Christians to secularism. Mainline denominations are undermined from within by liberal theology. The Church is attacked (or ignored) by a media loyal to secular humanism and homosexualism. In 1987 a DAWN (Discipling A Whole Nation) Strategy was launched. Research showed that the Baptists were growing, and some of the newer Pentecostal denominations were growing rapidly. A DAWN Congress in 1989 brought some church leaders together to set church planting goals. However, DAWN did not capture the attention of the larger mainline denominations, nor of the many parachurch or specialist agencies in New Zealand. There was no common vision. At the Lausanne Congress in Manila in 1989, the Lord showed us the need for a second phase of the DAWN Strategy, with a new name, and that although church planting had to be encouraged as a priority for the denominations, we needed a comprehensive approach, that included church planting among many other ministries. In 1990 a meeting of about 70 representative leaders agreed to some very important principles, and Vision New Zealand was born: to call the Whole Church to take the Whole Gospel to the Whole Nation. God has led us in New Zealand to a vision for greater cooperation among the denominations to reach our nation. Our Mission Statement is as follows: Vision New Zealand has a two-fold focus for the Decade of Evangelism: We will study obstacles posed by our secular society to the advance of the Kingdom of God, and seek ways to overcome these. We will encourage Christian leaders to strengthen the quality and multiply the number of growing, caring, Christ-centred churches until there are sufficient to affect the spiritual and social climate of New Zealand. The task of evangelizing New Zealand will be attainable when there is at least one such congregation sharing Christ within easy access geographically, culturally, and linguistically of every person, i.e., approximately one for every 500 people. We will encourage every denomination in their commitment to growth, and every specialist ministry to assist denominations and churches in mission. Together we can do it! Our Convictions Together we can evangelize New Zealand. Together, we have the resources. The evangelization of a nation is a Process, not an Event, which must be indigenous to New Zealand, inclusive, affirming all ministries, based on sound missiological principles, and consistent with the DAWN Strategy (conduct research, have leaders agree, set goals, evaluate progress). Denominations, old and new, hold the key to multiplying congregations and preaching the gospel to every person. If they can catch the vision, they have the resources, the manpower and the money. Periodic Congresses are needed to bring every agency into a goal-centred process. Our first Congress was held in January 1993. We prepared a special research publication: New Vision New Zealand, which is available at GCOWE. The Congress addressed strategy. We limited the platform to New Zealand speakers, to affirm that God wants us to be responsible for the evangelization of our own nation. Since then evangelicals in the various mainline denominations have started new movements to bring theological renewal, and minor denominations have become more focused on church planting- evangelism. We have a long way to go! We see, from John 15:1-6, that God is throwing unfruitful vines into the fire, and pruning fruitful vines to make them more fruitful. Our next Congress is in July 1996, to review what God has done, and what we must do next. Article source: http://www.ad2000.org/gcowe95/nzealand.html",

    "content": "GCOWE &#39;95: National Research: Light For The Task Niyi Gbade, Nigeria Zonal Director, Calvary Ministries Chairman, AD 2000 National Research Mobilization Network Bob Waymire, USA President, Light International Coordinator, AD 2000 National Research Mobilization Network We must have light! We must know the situation as it really is, not what we imagine it to be. When we labor under ignorance and error, outdated and irrelevant information, the Kingdom of Darkness has a distinct advantage, and millions will never be brought into the light. Ask yourself: What do I really know about the advance of the Gospel in my country? Which people groups are still unreached, or nearly so? How many and where are the villages, towns and urban neighborhoods that have no Bible-believing churches? Which methods of evangelism and church-planting are proving to be the most productive? Where? Why? How fast is the national Church growing? Where? Who? What is the &quot;harvest force&quot; doing collectively in our nation or region? What is the population per church ratio for the nation? State/province? Urban center? If the Church keeps growing at the current rate, where will we be in 5 years? 20? Perhaps you&#39;re asking yourself, &quot;Why do I need to know all this &#39;big picture&#39; stuff?&quot; An individual soldier may not need to have the big picture of all the battlefields, but the battle commander and the line officers do. The battle commander must have an accurate, up-to-date picture of the enemy&#39;s location, strength, capabilities, movements, supply and intentions. He must also know his own force&#39;s strength and capabilities, their location and supply lines. The battle commander&#39;s goal is to win the war -- battle by battle. We need accurate, up-to-date, relevant information if we are to see the potential reached in completing the task of world evangelization -- &quot;making disciples of all nations.&quot; The next series of logical questions would relate to: a) the information (light) needed to underwrite and achieve these goals, and b) implications for the national Church. Who has this kind of information? Is it currently available? Being gathered? If so, how current is it? How often updated? What forms is it in? Is it published? Are there maps showing the location/distribution and status of the harvest force &amp; harvest field? Who should be involved? What structures should or would be appropriate? How much will it cost? Where will the support come from? Who should take the initiative? Who should provide the oversight? Permanent National Research Functions Each country needs an ongoing national-level research and information function that is designed and geared to providing accurate, up-to-date information for all those in the Body of Christ who need to make use of it. I call this a Permanent National Research Function (PNRF). The goal and purpose of the PNRF is to obtain, maintain and manage, analyze and report, publish and share that accurate, up-to-date relevant information the Body of Christ in the nation needs to carry forth its variety of ministries towards the completion of the Great Commission task. Ghana, the Philippines, India, Zimbabwe, Guatemala, Colombia, Brazil, New Zealand, England, Latvia and several other countries have, to varying degrees, a functioning national-level research and information function. However, none of these efforts are yet fully operational. The primary purposes &amp; functions of a PNRF (ref. NRMH pp. 4,5 -- see below) Coordinate and/or monitor research efforts within the country. Provide information resources via a &quot;national information resource center.&quot; Provide information management and analysis. Coordinate/provide training in research and information management, and information management tools. Communicate and present findings through a variety of media. Share information with others, including electronic networking. Basic structures or elements of a PNRF? (ref. NRMH pp.6-12 -- see below) The National Research and Information Committee is a decision-making body made up of representatives of various organizations, and is the body having the primary responsibility for seeing the PNRF established and operational. This committee is not responsible for actually gathering and/or managing the information, but for seeing that the right information is gathered and managed properly. This vital role necessitates highly qualified, experienced persons who have authority to act on behalf of their organizations. The Information Resource Center has actual stewardship of the information, including obtaining and managing data. It should be staffed by full-time, trained personnel. Its roles include designing/ adapting and coordinating surveys, providing information management and analysis including maps and graphics, providing training in surveys and information management, compiling reports, maintaining information in accessible forms and formats, linking with appropriate information-sharing networks, publishing and presenting findings and analysis... all on an ongoing basis. It is not an easy task to get the right information, in the right form, in the right hands, at the right time. However, it is absolutely essential if we are to see the Kingdom of Darkness defeated by the Kingdom of Light. Satan does not want the harvest force to know the facts. He doesn&#39;t want us to measure effectiveness or evaluate goals, plans and methods against valid data. Nehemiah provides a good Biblical lesson on God-guided plans and research. He was continually relying upon God, the Master Research Coordinator. His motives were to see God&#39;s people restored to their Lord, and their separation from the world (hence the rebuilding of the walls). His process was prayer- guided. The information obtained was used to motivate, mobilize and involve God&#39;s people, ultimately to praise, worship and celebrate their God. Detailed information regarding establishing Permanent National Research Functions, set forth in the National Research Mobilization Handbook, by Bob Waymire, is available from LIGHT Int&#39;l. Jim Montgomery, in DAWN 2000: 7 Millions Church To Go, refers to how the &quot;prophetic message,&quot; developed from the analysis of the harvest force and harvest field data, is used in setting national goals for new believers and churches: &quot;Such goals distill the data of the researcher and the message of the Lord into a clear, understandable vision that can easily be communicated. The goals become the driving force that mobilizes God&#39;s people to efforts they never dreamed possible.&quot; (p.143, emphasis mine) The National Research Mobilization Network is dedicated to assisting the national Church in every country to establish an ongoing research and information function in order for the Body of Christ to have the &quot;light&quot; it needs for effectively carrying forth the task of world evangelization. Countries that already have initiated PNRF&#39;s can share their experience. We can help supply needed tools and services, and/or coordinate training in information strategies, surveys and information management. We can supply research and strategy consultation. It is my dream that some day... we will see the enemy of our souls recoiling from the light that is shining forth in every country as the Body of Christ is methodically keeping an up-to-date picture of the harvest force and harvest force. ...There will be readily available maps of every country and urban area, depicting the distribution and status of the various ministries of the harvest force. ... There will be special teams in each region of the world who can provide technical and strategic research and information management know-how to others in the area. ...We will see the Body of Christ, having a clear picture of the objective, with a common goal, cooperating together, even with all of our different roles and talents. Having accurate, up-to-date, relevant information -- light -- in the right hands in the right time doesn&#39;t guarantee success... but we can&#39;t get there without it!

The primary target of the Mobilizing New Missionaries Network is the unreached peoples of the world with their staggering needs for gospel proclamation, church planting, and the establishment of the Kingdom of God in their midst. These thousands of unreached people groups encompass over 1 billion of the world&#39;s people. They have in their midst very few believers and missionaries, and very few (if any) churches in their language and culture. For these reasons and for the glory of the Lord Jesus, the Mobilizing New Missionaries Network seeks to raise up workers for them. The Mobilizing New Missionaries Network hopes to see national movements raise up as many as 200,000 or more new missionaries and indigenous church planters among the unreached in the next few years, with a vast percentage of those coming from developing nations. This so that our generation may do its part to see a church for every people by the year 2000. In our plenary session at GCOWE &#39;95, we have seven major sections: George Verwer starts off the plenary with introductions, and a message on &quot;Why do we need more missionaries for unreached peoples?&quot; George will give us a stirring and clear challenge to focus our efforts on the world&#39;s unreached people groups and on the critical need for more missionaries. As International Director of Operation Mobilization, George is well equipped to communicate the global needs and is considered by many to be one of the best recruiters for new missionaries across the world. Next, the MNM plenary session includes a video on the 10/40 Window, produced by Operation Mobilization. This exciting music video gives a quick grasp of the 10/40 Window in a way that is very applicable to God&#39;s new mission force in the current generation. Then, Mr. Inho Kim of Mission Korea will present on &quot;International Partnership for Reaching the Unreached&quot;, which is an overview of the key commitments we must have across the body of Christ in partnership for reaching unreached peoples. Albert Seth Ocran of Torchbearers will portray important developments in &quot;Mobilizing New Missionaries from Denominations and Local Churches.&quot; Mr. Ocran is a key missions mobilizer from Ghana, and has worked specifically for motivating, mobilizing, and monitoring Christians for missions in this nation and in West Africa. In the next section, an unreached people mobilization video will be shown that was recently developed in France for dubbing into many different languages. Gladys Acuna from Guatemala touches on the subject of &quot;Our Commitment to Work Together for the Sake of Reaching Unreached Peoples.&quot; The key areas of partnership across denominations, across churches, and the need to partner with the Lord Jesus himself will be touched in this encouraging testimony by this key missions mobilizer for Latin America. Finally, Pari Rickard, the International Coordinator for the AD2000 Mobilizing New Missionaries Network, will give a closing commentary on &quot;Mobilizing New Missionaries -- The Future.&quot; This will take a look at future directions, practical steps and the hopes of those who have attended the Mobilizing New Missionaries Network meetings during the week of GCOWE.

In October 1993, between 20 and 30 million Christians around the world were praying and fasting for the 62 nations of the 10/40 Window in a synchronized manner -- two nations per day. Meanwhile, 270 prayer journey teams from many nations moved into the 10/40 Window itself for warfare prayer behind enemy lines. We called this &quot;Praying Through the Window.&quot; The next major target for global prayer journeys will be the 100 most strategic gateway cities in the 10/40 Window. The time: October 1995. Called &quot;Praying Through the Window II,&quot; the vision is for 30 to 50 million Christians to pray and fast for these cities through the month, three each day and four to five on Sundays. During the month it is planned that 100 intercessors will pray on site in each city, about 25 each week.

    "content": "GCOWE &#39;95: Latin America: A Continent on Fire Valentin Gonzalez-Bohorquez AD2000 Director for the Hispanic World Economic and Political Realities During the last ten years, Latin America has definitely begun establishing democratic governments and political liberties, as well as the exercising of human rights. Such things were, until recently, unimaginable in some countries subjugated during long decades by military dictatorship or oppressive governments. Today, every government in Latin America, except for Cuba, has been elected by popular vote, even though in countries like Mexico and the Dominican Republic there has been alleged fraud. Despite such positive changes in this region, social injustice and economic differences still affect much of the population and poverty continues to rise, weakening mainly the middle classes. Drug-dealing, the gap between the rich and the poor, and the rapid increase in population are some of the many unsolved problems of this region. The decrease of Marxist revolutionary guerrillas is one of the characteristics of these last years, due to the worldwide downfall of communism. Only in Peru, and in a lesser degree in Guatemala and Colombia, are the guerrillas wars continuing. In Mexico there has been an outburst of violence and assassinations of prominent politicians, while in El Salvador and Nicaragua peace is still vulnerable. The drug-dealing empires have become powerful and have openly challenged national and local governments and have also performed terrorist acts. This is still one of the biggest problems in Colombia, Panama and Peru. One of the strongest trends in economics has been the establishment of alliances, viewed by some with skepticism, since some favor the strongest or those who have the most products to export. Others, however, consider that they contribute to an integral and balanced development of the region. Some of these alliances are the Free Trade Treaty (FTT) between Mexico, the United States and Canada; MERCOSUR, which includes the nations of South Cone, and the first of all these alliances, the Andean Pact, in which the nations of the Andes participate. One of Latin America&#39;s main resources is probably the optimism of its people, their sense of self-improvement as they face adversity, as well as the enormous potential of their natural and human resources. These factors cause the Latin Americans to view their immediate future positively and to hope for a better social well-being for which every must strive to achieve. Religious Realities At the beginning of this century, almost all of the Latin American population was Roman Catholic. However, one of the most dramatic religious transformations in history has taken place during this century. Despite the systematic opposition coming from the Catholic Church, missionary activity as well as national initiative were some of the factors that allowed a rapid increase among the evangelicals, reaching about 50 million people up to this moment and expecting an increase up to 80 or 90 million by the AD2000. It is estimated that 11% of the Latin Americans nowadays are evangelical. Economic struggles, war among the guerrillas, earthquakes and dictatorships have been crucial factors that have helped to accelerate the people&#39;s response to the proclamation of the Gospel. The growth among the Pentecostals has been extraordinary. It is estimated that 40% of all the members of Pentecostal denominations are in Latin America. As they have read God&#39;s Word, many Catholics have opened their hearts to have a personal encounter with Jesus and many of them have turned into zealous evangelicals or have stayed within the Catholic Church, mainly with the Charismatic Movement. Generally speaking, the Evangelical Church is also growing among the isolated Indian communities of the continent which have been resisting the Gospel for a long time. The Bible translation task as well as the Summer Institute of Linguistics has greatly contributed to greater breakthroughs among the Indian peoples in Latin America. The upper classes, the college students and the immigrant minorities are still unreached. During the past decades a strong movement to encourage the Latin American churches to get involved in cross-cultural missions has risen. Between 1980 to 1988, the Latin American missionary agencies increased by 84% and the number of missionaries by 243%. Since 1987 up to the present much of the cross-cultural missionary zeal has been launched by the Ibero-american Missionary Cooperation (COMIBAM), and it continues encourage and train Latin American missionaries to go to the unreached. Some of the pioneers in this task are Brazil, Peru, Chile, Costa Rica, Puerto Rico, El Salvador and Mexico. AD2000 in Latin America: A Regional Model Antecedents The structure and the steady growth of the evangelical church in Latin America provided for the vision of global mobilization and the world&#39;s evangelistic saturation to be rapidly adopted in the Hispanic continent. From the beginning of this decade, different denominations, missionary and evangelistic organizations, as well as entities involved with work at both national and regional levels, began to design projects within their areas of ministry focused on the year 2000. Aside from the World Missions Congresses sponsored by COMIBAM in different Hispanics countries, other ministries such as the Alberto Motessi, Luis Palau and Billy Graham evangelistic associations, Campus Crusade, and Vela Ministries among others, began to make plans concerning their ministries focusing on the 90&#39;s, while denominations like the Assemblies of God launched the Harvest Decade and the Church of God (Cleveland) created an army of one million intercessors to pray for world evangelization. Creation and Development of the Regional Resources Network Luis Bush, who has played a decisive role in the creation of COMIBAM and the development of the vision for cross-cultural missions in Latin America, now as International Director of AD2000 &amp; Beyond Movement, began the creation of AD2000 National Committees in every Hispanic country. He emphasized GCOWE to take place in May 1995 in Korea as a key moment in the development of the AD2000 &amp; Beyond Movement. With the help of many leaders who are familiar with the Latin America reality as well as with its leadership, National Coordinators were appointed and the process to choose those who will participate in GCOWE and as network representatives of their countries was begun. Since then, the Movement has found a quick and deep response, support, understanding and participation on the part of many organizations and churches in the continent, since they were longing for a project with such characteristics. In 1993, in San Juan Capistrano, California, an important meeting took place where Hispanic evangelical leaders agreed to launch a program know as Partnership 2000, which at first was to represent all of the AD2000 Movement in Latin America. However, it was later understood through the subsequent process, that Partnership 2000 actually emphasized the evangelistic saturation of the Latin American countries, therefore. AD2000 and the leaders of Partnership 2000 understood that the main interest of the latter was evangelization. It was thus decided for Partnership 2000 to represent the AD2000 Evangelism Network for Latin America. At present, Partnership 2000, led by the evangelist Alberto Motessi, groups more than 30 missionary agencies and international evangelical organizations working in Latin America and helps to develop national evangelistic initiatives in different countries of the continent such as Costa Rica 2000, Peru for Christ, Central America 2000, and Colombia Today and Tomorrow. Until now, Partnership 2000 is one of the most developed AD2000 networks in L.A. COMIBAM -Ibero-american Missionary Cooperation, represents the Unreached Peoples Regional Network, developing a steady task of encouraging, training and sending Latin American missionaries into the world&#39;s least evangelized peoples. COMIBAM has created an Adopt-A-People Department to contribute to the investigation, research and to teach the Hispanic churches how to adopt unreached peoples. The original goal proposed by COMIBAM was to launch the adoption of 3,000 unreached peoples. Many countries in this region are participating in this missionary strategy. Costa Rica, Puerto Rico, Brazil, El Salvador, Argentina among others, have already selected the amount of unreached peoples for them to reach and these countries are sending missionaries to Northern Africa, the Middle East, Asia, Southern Europe, the former Soviet Union and to the Indian communities within the Hispanic region. Another area that has been greatly mobilized within AD2000 Networks is that of Saturation Church Planting, represented by DAWN Ministries for Latin America and led by the Colombian pastor Bernardo Salcedo along with a group of leaders from this region. DAWN has more than 40 national church planting projects, virtually in every L.A. country. This network is also in charge of the Research Network, which precedes both the evangelist and the church planting efforts. Actually DAWN has developed excellent research concerning the national realities of countries such as El Salvador, Peru and Colombia, which are a valuable resource to visualize the task and develop long and short term planning strategies. The Cities Resources Network is represented by the project Christ for the City, from the Latin American Mission (LAM), led by Paul Landrey. The purpose of Christ for the City is to reach all the different social spheres of the major cities in L.A. through pastoral training and strategies planning. Due to the fact that this region has huge cities such as Mexico City (the largest in the world), Rio de Janeiro, Sao Paulo, Buenos Aires, Bogota, Caracas, Lima, Santiago, Quito, the Christ for the City project is seen as one of the most important attempts in the job of Latin American evangelization and integral transformation. For many years, in the area of Bible translation, production and distribution, two organizations have played a decisive role in L.A.: United Bible Societies (UBS) and the Summer Institute of Linguistic (SIL). The AD2000 God&#39;s Word and Literature Resource Network for L.A. is represented by Dr. Jaime Goytia from Bolivia, who is the Regional Director of UBS. Together with SIL, those two organizations have translated the Word of God into many dialects and indigenous communities in the Hispanic continent, on many occasions with the opposition of secular organizations that are unable to understand the sacrificial work that the linguistics and other supportive personal of these missionary agencies have to undergo. The Women&#39;s Regional Network, directed by Maria Cabrera, from Argentina, is organizing seminars and conferences in each country of Latin America in order to promote the participation of the evangelical woman in the praying efforts as well as in all the areas of evangelization. In spite of the historical resistance to involve the L.A. women in ministries associated only with men (such as pastoring and preaching), Latin American women have been able to gain recognition based on very fruitful and successful ministries. Another very productive Regional Network at this moment is the Radio Task Force, represented by organizations such as Transworld Radio (TWR), HCJB and Alas, who have main bases in Latin American countries and are among the most potent radio transmitters in the world. As part of the strategy of AD2000, these evangelical radio-transmitters are producing programs in the various indigenous languages of the region or in languages of unreached peoples from different continents. The Regional Prayer Network, directed by Harold Caballeros, a pastor from Guatemala, is advancing a plan to establish prayer networks in each country of L.A., called &quot;Jesus is Lord,&quot; under close coordination with Dr. Peter Wagner, focusing on spiritual warfare in behalf of the evangelization of unreached peoples. Pastor Hector Torres, National Coordinator of AD2000 U S Hispanics, has two valuable books concerning missionary intercessory prayer which are widely used as training tools in the Spanish-speaking world. Finally, we mention the Regional Pastors Network which is in charge of coordinating the March for Jesus, under the continental direction of Dr. Ruben Proietti, who is also Executive Secretary of Latin American Evangelical Fellowship (CONELA) and Director for L.A. of Luis Palau Association. Last year, more than four million people participated in the MFJ in almost every country of the Hispanic world. The only three countries where the MFJ was not held (Colombia, Panama and Cuba) for political reasons, opened their churches for continuous prayer the very same day of the March for Jesus on June 24, 1994. It was in this region of the world where most Christians participated in the MFJ last year! AD2000 National Initiatives in Latin American Countries One of the most exciting elements in the development of the AD2000 &amp; Beyond Movement in the L.A. world is the springing up of national initiatives in various countries of the region. Among the best organized national projects are Costa Rica 2000, in which more than 90% of the evangelical Costa Rican churches are involved in an evangelistic saturation program, church planting in every province of this Central American country, and in the mobilization of Costa Rican missionaries to over 60 unreached peoples for the year 2000. Colombia Today and Tomorrow (whose report will be presented in GCOWE) is the most complete and ambitious project ever developed in the history of this country, involving the participation of the vast majority of evangelical churches with all AD2000 networks activated. Peru for Christ is another initiative for the year 2000 in which the majority of the evangelical denominations and organizations of the country are participating along with the participation of Partnership 2000 and DAWN for the development of a total program for the Gospel. More recently, Venezuela and Mexico have integrated national initiatives in the AD2000 context, and other L.A. countries are in the process of developing national strategies. During the course of the last three years, the AD2000 Movement, at the regional level, has participated in many Congresses, seminars and encounters such as COICOM, the Latin American Congress on Communicators and Media, the Training Institute of Partnership 2000 in Costa Rica, the Quadrennial Assembly of the CONELA and EXPOLIT &#39;95 World Mission Congress, where the vision has been shared with the regional leadership and with thousands of believers from all Hispanics countries. Perspectives It is the hope of the AD2000 Movement for the Hispanic World that from the end of GCOWE up to January 1996 each Spanish-speaking country would be able to structure a national project in which each of the working networks are functioning and to have made a notable contribution to the task of the evangelization of the world by December 31, 2000. In the Pre-GCOWE meeting held from November 28 to December 3, in Colorado Springs, 17 National Coordinators and representatives of AD2000 for L.A., participated in the editing of the Regional Profile and committed themselves to work with enthusiasm toward the complete saturation with the Gospel in their countries and the ongoing mobilization of a new cross-cultural missionary force from each country to the unreached world. In said document it was declared that the goal of the L.A. evangelical church was to establish &quot;A church for every people and the Gospel for every person in Latin America and the world by AD2000.&quot; At the same time they committed themselves to encourage, train and send L.A. missionaries to the unreached by the year 2000. The passage of Scripture adopted by the L.A. leadership for this prophetic perspective was Hab. 2: 14, &quot;For the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the Lord, as the waters cover the sea.&quot; This is our goal and our prayer.

    "content": "GCOWE &#39;95: India Model - Let Bharat Hear His Voice! Vararuchi Dalavai Regional Coordinator: South Asia, AD2000 &amp; Beyond Movement Coordinator: Asia, B.C.M. International It is a great joy for me to share and present what the Lord has been doing in our country and wants us to do. Great racial, ethnic, religious diversity makes the Indian society the most complex society on the face of the earth. The Hindu heartland of mystery and myth fascinates the natives as well as foreigners. The subcontinent of South Asia is geographically dominated by this country. The 631,149 villages are grouped as 465 districts, 25 states and seven Union Territories. Population increases at an explosive rate. Every year the population of Australia (18 million) is added to the 930 million (1995) of India of which one half live below the poverty line. By AD 2020 India will be the most populous country in the world with nearly 1.3 billion people. With present economic liberalization, the urbanization of the predominantly agrarian population is rapidly increasing. Urbanization will enormously increase the population of the urban poor which poses a challenge to the urban Christian Workers who are very few at present. Women, the custodians of the Indian culture, are the victims of the culture they protect. Most of the Indian women, who outnumber the male population, are desperately looking for spiritual and social liberation. Though the presence of the Church in India dates back to AD 56, most of the growth of the Christian population occurred during the last 200 years when the Father of the Modern Missionary Movement, William Carey, set his feet on the shore of India. This growth was through a series of peoples movement among the 1970s. These growing movements were contested by the increasing force of Hindu militant movements which turned into a powerful political force. Discriminatory legislation against the Christians inhibits conversions and deprives converts from the untouchables to Government allocated jobs and funds. Visas for expatriate missionaries are hard to obtain and the foreign missionary force is aging and in rapid decline. Revivals in South and North East India have become the cause for releasing an enormous indigenous missionary force and reviving local churches for missionary outreach. Indigenous missionary agencies increased spectacularly from 26 in 1972 to over 200 at present. This brought an increase in indigenous missionaries from 550 to 11,500. The growth of the charismatics is hard to measure for lack of statistics. Their growth has been remarkable during the last decade. Every day about 5,000 Christians are added to the 42 million in existence. About 30 congregations are added every week to the existing 150,000 congregations. In India, the year AD2000 was focused as a rallying point initially by organizations and denominations that were already moving toward Networking relationships. Since 1989 with the dawn of AD2000 movement a &quot;stand alone&quot; position was biblically refuted, and now many indigenous agencies work in a spirit of cooperation. There is an increasing awareness for networking and partnership. The biblical reality of belonging to the body of Jesus Christ began to be expressed in several partnerships. The AD2000 movement has instilled purpose in the body of Christ and church planting is now the chief activity of several denominations and mission agencies. Today, the AD2000 Movement has become nationally accepted and every day it gains new momentum. Goal setting and the importance of prayer are the chief ingredients of the movement in India. More than 100 evangelistic agencies -- church and mission -- have adopted AD2000 goals. Several other National Networks have become involved since 1989. The most notable are Mission India 2000 (MI 2000) Council on National Service (CONS), Indian Missions Association (IMA), and Final Thrust 5000 (FT 5000). Regional networks like Vision 2000, in Salem, Tamilnadu have initiated partnership and generated enormous power for church planting at the grass roots level. They have mobilized 400 pastors from several denominations who have planted about 600 new churches within two years as a part of Vision 2000. Taking the lead from other networks, especially CONS, the participants of the Pre-GCOWE gathering took up the challenge of initiating a mission movement for India&#39;s unreached peoples. Remarkably this is 30% of the world&#39;s unreached peoples. The goal is to plant churches in all the remaining 500,000 villages and in several thousand unevangelized segments of the 300 largest cities in India. To achieve these goals, delegates have agreed to cooperate with the India Mission Association, which networks to place an evangelist in every postal code area. We all know how essential prayer is. The Indian church is becoming a praying church. Our Prayer Network has planned to identify and mobilize 100,000 prayer warriors to focus their efforts on 100 gateway cities and the 2700 unreached peoples groups of India. Our Women&#39;s Network is planning to form prayer groups across the country and is initiating pioneering Church Planting efforts to get into segments of the Indian society where men cannot go. The Pastors Network and Mobilizing New Missionaries Network have separately planned to mobilize, train and make available 85,000 pastors/church planters/missionaries to add to the expanding harvest force. Researchers have planned to network together to generate information on our harvest field and harvest force both in rural and urban populations by 1998. Our Urban Network is drawing up plans to concentrate on India&#39;s 100 largest cities in order to develop leadership and create local networks before the year 2000. We are committed to meet the increasing challenges of Urban Ministries. Our Radio Task Force has planned to coordinate the efforts of the all radio-broadcasting agencies, helping to plant churches in the 24 Indian languages with one million speakers which do not have church movements. By God&#39;s grace, regional, state and district level networks have been formed, priorities are set and action plans are ready. The vision and task of reaching India in this century has brought together an army of lay people and full-time workers in an unprecedented act of cooperation. As we go back to our respective countries having met, interacted, heard and seen the presentations, we are excited and we are motivated to join with you to &quot;Declare His glory among the heathen, His wonders among all people.&quot; May the peace of God the Father, love of God the son Jesus Christ, communion and comfort of God the Holy Spirit be with us and empower us. Amen. Article source: http://www.ad2000.org/gcowe95/dalavai.html",

    "content": "GCOWE &#39;95: God&#39;s Word and Literature John Bendor-Samuel, UK Chairman, God&#39;s Word &amp; Literature Network Executive Director, Wycliffe Bible Translators Dick Eastman, USA Coordinator, God&#39;s Word &amp; Literature Network President, Every Home for Christ We all agree -- everyone needs to have and understand God&#39;s Word. Only Scripture shows us who God is. His character and purposes are revealed nowhere else. Jesus told us &quot;to make disciples of all peoples... teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you....&quot; To be a disciple everyone needs the Bible. The goal of a church for every people must include providing that church with the Scriptures and with gospel literature that can be used in a systematic plan to evangelise a nation. Our goal then is to alert and mobilise Christian churches and organisations and to encourage them to network so that the resources needed to accomplish this task can be released and used as effectively as possible. There are four main aspects to the task; translation, the production of appropriate Scriptures, distribution and nurture. Translation God&#39;s Word must be in a language people can understand. The trade language may be adequate enough for buying food and clothes in the market but most people can only think about God and the spirits, or about what is right and wrong and indeed all spiritual and moral issues in their own language. The Bible is now available in 342 languages and the New Testament in a further 823 and this covers 86% of the world&#39;s population. Another 1,000 peoples have a portion of Scripture but need more. A thousand more (perhaps 3,000 more!) languages have been identified as needing Scripture. So the translation task is still huge. Can it be done? The answer is &quot;yes and soon.&quot; The pace of Scripture translation has been accelerating. In the last century 400 languages received some portion of Scripture; in this century four times as many, over 1,600 languages have received some Scripture. In fact in the last 45 years more languages have received some Scripture than in all the previous centuries put together. God has provided new technology to speed up the translation task, e.g., the computer. When there are related languages, a thorough linguistic analysis makes it possible to programme the computer to take Scriptures in one language and produce a rough draft in the related language. Of course this draft still requires a lot of work with speakers of the language, but it is a huge step forward. What is needed to complete the task? Christian leaders in every country need to draw up a strategy to find out where the remaining translation needs are and to set priorities. Hundreds of specialists as well as local language personnel must be trained, and they will require equipment and funds. The Forum of Bible Agencies, comprising most of the major international Bible agencies, is seeking to facilitate this. Production The Scriptures, as well as evangelistic literature, need to be produced in forms that people will want and in quantities and at prices that make them accessible. In recent years work has been carried out to produce Scriptures in a variety of forms to meet the needs of different readers -- new readers selections for those becoming literate, selections that speak to particular issues that are culturally relevant and so on. The needs of those who don&#39;t or won&#39;t read are also being met. Audio cassettes and video presentations of Scriptures are proving very popular in many places. What is needed? The Bible agencies are co-operating in developing ongoing plans to meet the variety of production needs. Good networking between the Bible agencies and the churches is essential if the right products are to be produced. A country by country plan is needed. Organisations publishing evangelistic booklets, tracts and Scripture portions need increasingly to consider pooling their literature so it can be part of a systematic plan to cover an entire nation. Distribution The mobilising of all God&#39;s people in a country is necessary for the effective distribution of Scripture and gospel literature. Every family unit, every home, every village, every people group, and every section of every town need to be reached. An immense task but do-able. GWALT seeks to mobilize, as well as serve, a broad coalition of ministry entities, including churches, Bible societies, literature distribution and media ministries, to embrace and participate in a nation by nation strategy to systematically deliver a clear presentation of the Gospel message (based on the Scriptures) to every family, or household, of a nation. At the same time it seeks to distribute the Scriptures themselves in a measurable way to all believers who might result from the strategic distribution of the printed (or recorded) evangelistic messages, or to those who simply have no Bible. To date, ministries involved in the GWALT strategy are conducting such distribution outreaches in more than 85 nations (including hundreds of unreached people groups) with new campaigns planned for about 25 additional nations between May 1995 and December 31, 1996. Systematic evangelistic literature distribution strategies are planned to be launched or completed in all nations by the year 2000, depending on prayer breakthroughs in the more restricted Islamic nations. Distribution of Scripture and gospel literature is also accelerating. From a total of 70 million Bibles and New Testaments distributed in 1970, distribution has doubled to an estimated 150 million this year. The distribution of Scripture portions multiplied 80 times from the 20 million being distributed each year distributed at the beginning of the century to the 1,700 million currently being distributed each year. What is needed? Christian leaders with a vision for the power of God&#39;s Word and gospel literature. And then an on-the-ground strategy for each country that will develop a plan -- district by district, people group by people group, town section by town section... to ensure that all are included. GWALT is seeking to foster this through a networking strategy. Nurture New believers and new churches need to be trained to use God&#39;s Word, and to apply it in their daily lives and in their ministry to their own people. Ways of doing this, together with the provision of Bible study materials, are crucially important. This calls for a whole variety of materials and approaches to suit the diversity of situations around the world. GWALT also seeks to use Bibles, New Testaments, Scripture portions, and basic Bible correspondence courses (both printed and recorded), in a broad range of follow-up and nurturing programs designed to disciple new believers, channel them into existing evangelical churches, or plant new fellowships of believers where no such churches presently exist. Various GWALT participating ministries already have goals of planting as many as 300,000 such fellowships by the year 2000. And current GWALT supporting organizations are expecting an estimated two million new believers annually to respond to printed evangelistic message or Scripture portions. What is needed? Again, a countrywide plan broken down by the significant people units within that country -- people groups, segments of towns, etc. Christian leaders networking together and with the specialist agencies are the key to successful nurturing.

    "title": "GCOWE '95: Canada Model",
    "content": "GCOWE &#39;95: Canada Model Donald J. Moore, Canada Director, Vision 2000 Launch Since its launch in 1990, Vision 2000 Canada has emerged as a movement committed to evangelism, now embracing more than 100 denominations and parachurch ministries in Canada. Its mission statement is clear: Vision 2000 Canada seeks to serve the Body of Christ in evangelism so that every person in Canada will have the opportunity to see, hear and respond to the Gospel by the year 2000. Beginnings In 1986, at the urging of key Christian leaders, the Evangelical Fellowship of Canada formed a task force to study the state of evangelism in Canada. In June of 1987, the task force forged the name Vision 2000 Canada and soon after, Dr. Don Moore, former Dean of Graduate Education at Briercrest Schools in Saskatchewan, was named Executive Director. Strategy Eight strategy groups consisting of well-respected Christian leaders researched the status of evangelism and submitted their findings in Ottawa at the historic launch of this decade committed to evangelism in May of 1990. More than 700 participants, from nearly sixty denominations and parachurch ministries sparked a tremendous sense of vision, unity and commitment for evangelism. Denominational leaders accepted the challenge, leading their churches in a vision-casting process, resulting in the formation of decade plans for evangelism. Mandate In April 1992 Vision 2000 Canada refocused and refined its mandate, leading toward a series of mid-decade consultations on evangelism in 1995. The mandate is: to mobilize church and parachurch leaders with vision and hope to reach our nation for Christ through commitment and cooperation. Here is how their four objectives are achieved: Vision: by informing one another of critical needs and opportunities for evangelism; Hope: by inspiring one another with illustrations of what God&#39;s people are doing in evangelism; Commitment: by influencing one another to make evangelism a high priority in our ministries; Cooperation: by initiating efforts and coordinating evangelism strategies which will strengthen our collective endeavours. 1995 Consultations on Evangelism In preparation for the mid-decade Consultations, a 224 page book entitled &quot;In Search of Hidden Heroes: Evidence that God is at Work&quot; was written to reveal how God&#39;s people are making evangelism happen in unique ways. During January - March, more than 2000 people participated in the 1995 Consultations on Evangelism hosted in eight centres across Canada. Each Host Team shaped their weekend Consultation to equip and energize God&#39;s people in light of the regional issues facing them in evangelism. A &quot;State of the Nation&quot; report was prepared for response by denominational and parachurch leaders during the National Leadership Consultation on Evangelism held March 30 - April 1. Emerging from the National Consultation was a tremendous recommitment to our mission and calling as we move towards the year 2000. Article source: http://www.ad2000.org/gcowe95/moore.html",

    "title": "GCOWE '95: Brazil Model",
    "content": "GCOWE &#39;95: Brazil Model Oswald Prado National Coordinator, AD2000 Brazil Brazil has become known as the land of soccer. We have already become World Champions four times. But our country is also known for other peculiar characteristics: Who has not heard of the way in which our nation bows to the lusts of the flesh at the annual festival of Carnival? Who has not also noticed the incredible contrast in the standards of living of our people? In a single neighborhood one can find homeless, hungry children walking the same streets in which wealthy and powerful businessmen and industrialists live in beautiful mansions. This is a desperate example of the social injustice that still dominates Brazil. The apex of our social pyramid is reached by very few. The vast majority remain at its lower levels their entire lives. As a result of this social disequilibrium, education is a commodity for the privileged few. Only 12.9% of those children who enter primary school make it to secondary school; only 1.5% go on to college. Will Brazil always be synonymous with soccer, Carnival, and social injustice? Certainly not! In fact, there are truths about Brazil that remain hidden to many outside its borders: Within Brazil God has united the various races of the world. Portuguese (arriving in the 16th century) and Africans from Angola and West Africa intermarried creating a new race: the mulattos. Asians began emigrating to Brazil at the beginning of this century, beginning with the Japanese and, more recently, Koreans. And even with their decreasing numbers, due to the advance of the colonizers, illness, and shrinking territorial limits, the indigenous peoples of Brazil still present an enormous challenge for evangelization and the full translation of God&#39;s Word into their languages. The mineral wealth of Brazil represents an enormous holding. Brazil possesses soil that is extremely fertile, and supplies a tremendous variety of foods to world markets. Brazil possesses a unique natural beauty, including the spectacular beaches and the five million square kilometers of the Amazon. Growth and progress of the past decades have also reached the great urban centers of Brazil. Sao Paulo, with its 21 million inhabitants, has become the third largest metropolis in the world, and projections for the year 2000 indicate it will soon be second. Technological advances are reflected in Brazil&#39;s industrial production. For nearly a year Brazil has been living with a manageable inflation of approximately 1 to 2% a month. This has bestowed a new sense of security to our people, as well as to our nation&#39;s businessmen. Religious syncretism is prevalent in Brazil. With our extremely diversified religious heritage, borrowing from medieval Catholicism, and African and indigenous religions, Brazil is considered a religious amalgam. Although officially identified as a predominantly Catholic nation, reality demonstrates otherwise. Catholicism has experienced substantial losses in membership in the past few years, while spiritism in its varied forms, including Umbanda and Macumba, has experienced surprising growth. There now exist numerous spiritist centers scattered throughout our cities. The recent growth of esoteric movements such as New Age has particularly touched the highest strata of the Brazilian social structure. The principle means of both written and spoken communication are dominated by the dissemination of esoteric principles. You may be asking yourself why, then, is the Brazilian delegation the fourth largest in this gathering? Why has so much been said about the growth of evangelicals in Brazil? There are always two sides to every coin. The evangelical population of Brazil is growing as it has never grown in any other moment in our history. In 1890 we numbered 143,000. In 1950: 1.7 million. In 1960: 2.8 million. In 1970: 4.8 million. In 1980: 7.9 million. And finally, at the beginning of our present decade, we numbered in excess of 17 million. If we continue to grow at this present rate, by the year 2014 we evangelicals will constitute 50% of the entire population of Brazil. In addition to our numerical growth, the Brazilian church has also matured in its understanding of its missionary role in the world. After having received the gospel approximately 150 years ago, principally through North American missionaries, the Brazilian church and its missions movement received a strong impetus at the 1987 COMIBAM Missions Congress. Three thousand delegates, together with numerous international observers, convened in Sao Paulo, representing Spanish and Portuguese speaking countries throughout the world. As a result of this event, churches, denominational boards, and interdenominational mission agencies began to receive a new vision for reaching the unreached, within Brazil and beyond. Through this awakening, the Brazilian church came to experience an unprecedented moment in its history: for decades it essentially existed for itself with little concern for world evangelization. In the past few years, however, local churches, denominational boards, interdenominational agencies, theological institutions, publishing houses, radio and television, etc. have thrown themselves body and soul into the missionary task. Resident within a country of continental dimensions, the evangelical church of Brazil has become conscious of its enormous responsibility to evangelize those areas in which the yet-unreached are located. How can we close our eyes to the many indigenous tribes that have not yet heard the gospel? Is it possible to ignore the pressing needs of the draught-ridden backlands of the northeast, a section of Brazil in which spiritual and economic poverty reign? Millions of Brazilian souls continue without the knowledge of Christ! The task within is great! Yet to refrain from looking outward at other unreached peoples would not only be egotistical, but would also demonstrate a lack of commitment to the Word of God. Although not as vigorous as we would like it to be, cross-cultural missions is a reality in Brazil. There are Brazilian missionary families working in all of the inhabitable continents of the world today. Two thousand Brazilians have left their families, churches, and countries to be sent overseas. What then are the dreams of the Brazilian evangelical church for the end of this millennium? Mobilize each local church to maintain an active missions vision such that each city and populace within Brazil receives the gospel and possesses a witnessing church. Simultaneously, these same churches should be training and sending missionaries to other peoples, especially those within the 10/40 window. Establish an immediate commitment to unity within the evangelical population of Brazil. This will only be possible as the Holy Spirit moves us to maintain the salvation of souls as our priority. Assume a commitment to thoroughly reach the indigenous tribes of Brazil, principally through translation of the Bible into all dialects. Lead each Brazilian evangelical to demonstrate a commitment to the whole gospel, meaning that we work toward the end that justice and a Christian ethic be ever more present in the life of Brazilian society. Use correctly the resources that God has placed in our hands, investing generously in the work of the Lord. Refrain from looking only at ourselves, our denomination, or whatever our institution, but having a wide, encompassing vision of our partnership in His mission, thereby hastening the return of Christ. Finally, develop strategies so the AD2000 &amp; Beyond Movement becomes a reality in Brazil: a church for every people, and the gospel for every person by the year 2000. The Brazilian delegation, by its presence here, is making a commitment to God and with History: We will get on God&#39;s team, we will enter into the conflict against the enemy, and we will fight as never before in this final century, so that the name of Jesus will be known and victorious, to the ends of the earth!

    "title": "GCOWE '95: An Anglican Vision for the Decade of Evangelism",
    "content": "The Church Exists for Mission Cyril C. Okorocha Director for Mission and Evangelism Anglican Communion Secretariat, London An Anglican Vision for the Decade of Evangelism The Anglican vision of a Decade of Evangelism is not an ad hoc programme which we will soon get over with and then return to &quot;normal Church life.&quot; In point of fact, for us, normal Church life is one underpinned by a belief that the central import of our Lord&#39;s Great Commission is that the Church exists for mission. Thus any Church not committed to evangelism loses her identity as the Church of Jesus Christ and soon becomes a mission field for other religions. Mission is a holistic venture The Decade vision places no dichotomy between mission and evangelism. Rather it sees mission as a holistic venture in which the Church unites all her God-given resources -- spiritual, material and sacramental -- in a relentless struggle to bring harmony of life, healing and hope to a sick and confused humanity. This mission includes five inseparable and equally essential aspects: Proclamation First, we must tell a world ruled by fear and battered by hatred, of God&#39;s immeasurable love and forgiveness as revealed in Jesus Christ. The Good News of Jesus Christ is the power of God that brings salvation to everyone who believes and the ability to believe, or saving faith, comes through hearing the word about Christ. Demonstration Second, those who proclaim the Good News must become that Good News in their context. This can sometimes mean costly sacrifice. Showing God&#39;s love to a world embittered by prejudice and violence can be a hazardous adventure. But it cost Jesus everything to bring us that love. The Church must therefore be willing to embrace the risks that are as a result of her mission in the world. Paul argues that there is something positively revolutionary about being a Christian. For, then the love of Christ controls us (2 Cor. 5:14). Preservation Third, is a serious effort by the Church to preserve the meaning and message of the Gospel in four vital areas of human life: The Church must by words and actions remind humankind that there is a sacredness about God&#39;s creation which we ignore to our peril. The Church must work to preserve the justice of God in society. The Church must work to preserve the presence of God in the family. A nation or civilisation stands or falls at the threshold of its families. The Church must assert by word and action that all persons are equal irrespective of colour, race, status or gender, because all are created by, and in the image of, God; and that the moral conduct that honours God is that revealed in the New Testament. Anticipation The Church by her proclamation and conduct must constantly remind the world that God&#39;s Good News has a futuristic aspect -- a message of enduring hope. Thus the vision of the Decade of Evangelism is fundamentally a vision of renewed faith in God&#39;s triumph in His world. Participation in Partnership Completion of world evangelisation or shifting the Church from a maintenance posture to a mission movement seem impossible challenges, but that vision can be realised if we can find the humility, love and faith to unite the material resources and historical experience of the Church in the North with the spiritual vibrancy and dedication of the Churches in the South, we have a formidable army. If this model of partnership is taken seriously, then the goal of the AD 2000 Movement could be realised. And in that case, the measure of the success and enduring value of the vision of the Decade of Evangelism would not be so much in terms of how many new &quot;souls&quot; we have won to our side, important as this my be, or how many compliant believers we have retained in the pews, but of how much we have been able to mobilise Christians into once again joyfully and courageously becoming God&#39;s Good News in their context, and how much the Church as a community of faith has learnt to become a sacramental expression of God&#39;s presence and activity in His world. In short, my vision for this Decade and beyond is for a revitalised Church which, in witness and communion, is a true sign of the Kingdom of God -- rooted in biblical faith, dynamic in mission and evangelism, creative and joyful in worship, caring in fellowship and committed to social transformation through transformed people.

    "title": "GCOWE '95: A Decade of Harvest, Assemblies of God of Brazil",
    "content": "A Decade of Harvest Luis Bush Assemblies of God in Brazil Assemblies of God has a project called Decade of Harvest. It is global in scope. However, every nation has their own direction and administration of this vision. The purpose is the same as the purpose of AD2000, resulting in a close linkage between the organizations. For Brazil, we have 5 objectives: To raise up an army of 3,000,000 intercessors, by sending folders to churches, where they are handed out among the believers, who respond if they are interested. We return to them a calendar giving 3 specific areas to pray for every day. To win to Jesus Christ 50,000,000 people by AD2000. Our membership today is 13,000,000. To prepare 100,000 workers to serve the other two objectives To establish 50,000 new churches To send the number of missionaries that we are able to the missionary field. When these goals were established, it was somewhat of a shock. They were established in relation to the reality of present growth rates among the Assemblies of God Church, prior to the 1960s. The 50,000,000 target represents a church growth rate of 23%. According to a thesis done in 1963 at Fuller, church growth up to that time was 23%. Then it dropped to 5%. As a result of the Decade of Harvest, church growth has increased from 5% to 8%. What are we doing to mobilize the church? We are having conferences on the regional, state, and local levels. We are also mobilizing through Sunday School, where one trimester per year is dedicated to the project. There are 600,000 of these throughout Brazil, with the first one this year. Also, we are mobilizing through the Assem-blies of God newspaper and magazine. Another way is through evaluation congresses, such as the one this next February. We want to get back to what we had before 1963: a strong emphasis on lay evangelism, where every person was involved in leading people to Christ. Radio and other means of communication cannot replace personal evangelism, one on one. As a result of this, we are finding a greater unity in the body of Christ. Ten years ago, the Assemblies of God couldn&#39;t relate to any other denominations, but today we do. During Celebrating Planet Earth, the environmental summit held in 1992, over 1,000,000 believers met simultaneously in Rio de Jainero. Last October, the largest missions conference in Brazil was held, in cooperation with AD2000. December 17 we are inviting all the evangelicals in Rio to have a day of prayer (no preaching) against the violence occurring in that city.

    "title": "GCOWE '95 Day 7: Report by Brigada",
    "content": "GCOWE &#39;95 Day 7 - May 23, 1995 Doug Lucas GCOWE &#39;95 in Seoul Today we feature the following article from guest writer, David Hackett, who serves as General Director, Presbyterian Frontier Fellowship (Tel. 206-747-7714). He reports the experiences of Jefferson Ritchie, who is writing from here in Seoul: Reporting from Seoul, [Jefferson] Ritchie shows his exuberance at the consultation&#39;s progress. &quot;The spirit here is blowing our minds!,&quot; says Ritchie. The Presbyterian Church (USA) Associate for International Church Development and Evangelism says, &quot;I already sense two key themes developing: the first is people uniting to pray. The second is people uniting across all sorts of lines to strategize together on how best to evangelize the peoples of the world who don&#39;t yet have a witnessing church.&quot; Both aspects show the international Christian Church is learning how to connect with itself across formerly large boundaries of cultural, national and theological differences for the sake of reaching the unreached, he explains. One South Korean delegate said he was ready to make a major change in how he utilized networks in his ministry, exclaiming, &quot;This is a turning point in our mission work. We&#39;re finally beginning to understand what partnership is all about.&quot; That particular South Korean missionary lives in Germany and coordinates Korean outreach in several central European countries, including Albania, the Czech Republic and Slovakia. Throughout his travels he encourages Korean fellowships. Ritchie notes with humor the typical Korean creativity in how the Albanian ministry is succeeding in drawing together Albanian-residing Koreans. &quot;They&#39;re working with the Albanian Encouragement Project and have a church planter there, but they also have someone teaching Takwondo!,&quot; says Ritchie. Other long-term resentments were being overcome at the consultation, notes Ritchie. One particularly moving time was when a Japanese leader spoke on the theme of repentance and then called on any delegates from countries which had been invaded in the past by Japan in World War II to come forward. Delegates streamed forward from Korean, the Philippines, China, Malaysia, and other countries. To the gathered group the speaker asked for their forgiveness. Such actions have created a palpable atmosphere at the consultation with bitter spirits are being replaced by spirits of humility and renewed commitment to unity and cooperation. Ritchie is particularly impressed by the story of Delegate Mannu Arong, a missionary from India to Nepal. After having been deeply influenced by the 1984 International Prayer Summit, this woman started a prayer group in Nepal which has now grown so strong as a movement that most women&#39;s prayer groups in Nepal have a prayer track, modeled after Arong&#39;s group, praying for the growth of the church every Monday morning. &quot;This movement is providing a backbone of prayer to the emerging church in Nepal,&quot; Ritchie says. There is a notable Presbyterian presence at the Global Consultation, Ritchie says. &quot;We can celebrate that many of the key leaders at the consultation are Presbyterians...&quot; [end of article] Thanks Jefferson and David!!! Today&#39;s hours were invested in Tracks, which are smaller group meetings aimed at fostering the development of global or regional outreach plans based on common interest areas rather than on geography. Tomorrow, the conference goes into its final innings, with a day of regional meetings (e.g., continents), then a day of national meetings again on Thursday. Closing session is Thursday night. Since experiences in these individually-experienced sessions are so varied, it&#39;s hard to get a sense of where the conference is going, as a whole. I =can= say that the rooms today seemed buzzing with excitement.... reports, challenges, appeals, prayer, praise, singing, and much more. I can also testify that many seem very tired. At times, you can simply read the fatigue on a new acquaintance&#39;s face (as we&#39;ve said before, in most cases we&#39;ve had to leave the hotel at 7:30am and arrive home after 10pm -- with no chance to rest at all in between). In addition, there&#39;s been not a single day off since arriving. Some have joked that this conference might indeed go down in the Guinness World Book of Records... as the one that most resembled an endurance test!!! Another delegate quoted what he believed should become the AD2000 &amp; Beyond key scripture verse... &quot;We shall not sleep, but we shall all be changed!&quot; [grin] It&#39;s hard to know how deeply this draining schedule has impacted the consultation. There&#39;s no doubt that many are sleepy in afternoon sessions. (In fact, today, we saw men in small group settings, right in the middle of sub-Tracks, sprawled out on folding chairs trying to catch up on rest.) In addition, we continue to hear delegates wish that somehow the networking time could have been a more intentionally planned process. One representative suggested that perhaps there could have been free time in the afternoon in which organizations were asked to man &quot;booths&quot; with their displays, in a large &quot;hall of halls&quot;. Delegates could then file through booths to make contacts and &quot;network&quot;. On another day, key leaders/representatives from each country could be placed at booths (and there would be 190 of them!), allowing members of the organizations and churches to file through and meet =them=. You get the idea. As it stands, the Tracks ran all day, from 9am to 9pm, with time off only for lunch and supper. A side effect of this lack of intentional networking time is that, as we&#39;ve hinted before, there seemed to be little time for the average delegate to be involved in drawing up intentional strategies and action plans. On a stairway near the Cities Track today, one man explained that he thought this would be more of a &quot;working convention&quot; when in reality, it had been, for him, an &quot;inspirational convention&quot;. Keep in mind that those are just individual opinions. We&#39;re sure that those who =were= successful at networking and building relationships would have other reports. We cannot overstate it that this does not mean that the consultation wasn&#39;t successful -- but rather, that it was just different than the expected outcome. Also, as we&#39;ve said before, we&#39;re a bit disappointed about the lack of a solid target. If it&#39;s a &quot;church for every people&quot; that we&#39;re shooting for, then getting a list of &quot;every people&quot; is fundamental. In spite of the fact that everyone apparently thought this was forthcoming, Patrick Johnstone, for one, arrived here with deep regret in his master hand (as he viewed the list). Johnstone is author of Operation World. He contributed to earlier versions of the people group list, but didn&#39;t get a chance to help with the final product, he said. As a result, at GCOWE, he distanced himself from the final product. As for Brigada, we&#39;re probably going to urge users to check out the list being circulated by John Gilbert and the Southern Baptists. First, it is figured more on objective criteria -- some 79 parameters that he&#39;ll recall it so that he can update it each. Second, it&#39;s available. No waiting until 1998. No wondering about the subjectivity of the writer! To take the place of articles for tomorrow (Wed.) and Thursday (all day), the GCOWE Today (the printed newsprint journal distributed to all delegates) contributed articles that had reference for all. You can &quot;shop&quot; for files by sending a message to the hub computer at hub@xc.org with only the following line in the text of the message: filelist brigada-pubs-gcowenews Pick out the file(s) you want to retrieve and send another message to hub@xc.org with only the words... get brigada-pubs-gcowenews filename.ext where filename.ext is the filename and extension of the file you want. Remember that the hub uses Unix commands, meaning that the file name can be much longer. Just make sure you type them exactly as they appear in this report. The next time we write will be on Friday, May 26, after the closing of the conference. Pray for GCOWE! Article source: http://www.ad2000.org/gcowe95/brigada/day7.html",

    "content": "GCOWE &#39;95 Day 6 - May 22, 1995 Doug Lucas GCOWE &#39;95 in Seoul Today we met at the Presbyterian Church where the President of Korea attends! (There&#39;s something royal about being given a greeting from the Queen of Lesotho, one of the GCOWE delegates, knowing that you might be sitting in the same pew where Korea&#39;s President sat this past Sunday morning!) Gerry Seale gave &quot;A Call to Holiness&quot; -- and reminded us all of our responsibility to remain pure and of the highest integrity. But it was during the next segment, the report from the &quot;Denominational Leaders&#39; Track,&quot; where we heard what must be some of the biggest news of the day. Years ago it would have never been possible -- but we live in a new day! John Gilbert, head of the Southern Baptist&#39;s Global Research division, announced through Avery Willis his willingness to give complete copies of some very significant computer data files. By mid-July, John promised to mail out sets of diskettes ($15 in the USA, free to countries in the majority world) to all who requested them! These diskettes contain years of research and tons of data about the world in which we live. To get your own copy, sent $15 to John Gilbert, Foreign Mission Board, PO Box 6767, Richmond, VA 23230; Tel. 804-353-0151. Some believe that since this data will be so readily available, it might become somewhat of a standard in no time at all. What&#39;s more, it happens to be, in the opinion of some, one of the most objective approaches to classifying and measuring the progress toward world evangelization today. Gilbert&#39;s data follows some 79 unique parameters to clarify and categorize people groups. Since, according to the Barrett rep. here at GCOWE, Barrett&#39;s database on peoples won&#39;t be available for some time (maybe years), Gilbert&#39;s data will perhaps be the most statistically accurate information that we can get today... and for some time in the future. It will even contain maps with points representing the presence of each of 10,492 people groups, broken down into World A (10/40 Window groups -- for a total of 2,466), Unreached Peoples not in World A (3,965), Unevangelized peoples (those where over half have never heard the gospel with sufficient understanding as to accept it -- 2296 groups), Evangelized (in which at least half have heard -- 1735), and Christian peoples (where half have accepted Christ -- 30). Brigada will plan to feature these stats on line. During the Cities Network Presentation, Jackie Pullinger&#39;s impassioned plea for workers will not be soon forgotten. Her words on behalf of the poor were so stirring that the entire hall grew so silent you could have heard a pin drop. Her bottom line -- we&#39;ve got to make the poor a top priority, even though it will require sacrifice on all our parts. In fact, she was honest about the fact that it might even require death! The Light the Window video premier went over great! Michael Little, of CBN (the video&#39;s producer), was there to personally introduce it. Some felt it was among the most motivating videos of the entire consultation. (For a copy, write to Caleb Project, 10 West Dry Creek Circle, Littleton, CO 80120.) Later in the day, George Verwer premiered Bill Drake&#39;s new music video, &quot;Ten Four O&quot;, also on the 10/40 Window. Available for $10 from OM, PO Box 444, Tyrone, GA 30290-0444, Bill&#39;s video will be particularly effective with college age individuals and singles/careers. In other news, the AD2000 &amp; Beyond WorldWide Web page continues to grow -- browse it at http://www.ad2000.org/gcowe95 to see all the speakers&#39; manuscripts and other reports from Seoul. Tomorrow, we meet in tracks again. In fact, today was the last set of plenaries until the very closing session Thurs. evening. Please continue to pray for God&#39;s will to be done in Seoul.

    "content": "GCOWE &#39;95 Day 5 - May 21, 1995 Doug Lucas GCOWE &#39;95 in Seoul Well you&#39;ve heard of the Yoido &quot;Cho&quot; Church, right? So had I. But I had no idea just how much this church had accomplished over the past few years... until visiting today. It all started back in 1958... not really that long ago. The time was 5 years after the Korean War. 80% of all Koreans had TB. David Yonggi Cho had just graduated from seminary. His mother, later to be called the &quot;Hallelujah Mama,&quot; believed there was something special waiting for her son and prayed as such. That&#39;s when it all began... with prayer. Cho asked God what he should and could do &quot;for ourselves, for our family, and for the people of Korea.&quot; He felt that God was asking him to pray all the more. In fact, he began to feel as if God was wanting him to spend more and more time in prayer... until Cho could know for sure that his prayer had been answered. He began to pray with more and more determination... and God began to speak mightily to him. Cho bought a used army tent for $50 from the US military. He put it up on the worst side of Seoul. There were gangs, racketeers, selfish hustlers, and others who just wanted to take advantage of everyone they could in life, at any cost. That was Cho&#39;s turf. There were many nights he would spend praying the whole night long by himself in that big tent. Finally there were one or two others, but for the most part, it was three or three and 1/2 years before the &quot;windows opened.&quot; Cho says that they prayed for healing for a deaf person and he says the deaf person was healed. People wanted to know what had happened. The newly hearing person sent them to &quot;the tent&quot;. Cho says the same thing happened over and over with other ailments and problems. One Friday night, Cho, his &quot;Hallelujah Mama&quot; and the new group of newly-healed people went to the demilitarized zone (DMZ) and spent the whole night praying for a united Korea (they&#39;re still awaiting the answer to that prayer). In fact, Cho&#39;s &quot;Hallelujah Mama&quot; called the DMZ the &quot;Devil&#39;s Domain&quot;. She wanted to pray on a mountain near there, so they actually purchased a mountain 10 miles south of the border where on a clear day you can hear the propaganda from the speakers at the N. Korean border. Cho views the Bible as if it were ammunition -- but prayer is the gun. God began to answer those prayers, Cho says. And now, today, look at what has happened. Just 37 years after those lonely nights in the tent, the Yoido church has over 700,000 members! The primary building seats 25,000 people in one room. Another 17 overflow chapels provide seating for 20,000 via closed-circuit video. In addition, a real-time video link with a building in Japan via fiber optics provides seating (and a packed house) for 3500 more! And packed houses are what Cho is famous for... 45,000 people per service, 7 times every Sunday, 2 times every Wed., and twice on Sat... for a total of 12 services per week -- all packed!!! In addition, after his first sermon is videotaped on Sunday, seven deacons race to their cars and drive a copy of the video across town to outlying areas where, in 70 &quot;smaller&quot; outlying churches, some 35,000 per Sunday view Cho via delayed video! Through the present, there&#39;s no place to put the 36,000 children during Sunday School, so the church has purchased the building next door for US $40 million dollars! (The annual offerings run in the neighborhood of $100 million/year!) With Seoul&#39;s population of 11 million, this all goes to prove that literally 1 out of every 20 people in Seoul attend one of Cho&#39;s services each week! In addition, each day there are still an average of 3000 people praying at any one time up on that prayer mountain, now famous the world around. Cho himself shows up every morning in his own auditorium and just simply prays from 5:30-6:30am. Many from his congregation spend that hour praying with him. He likes to spend 3 hours/day.. and is disappointed that sometimes he can only stay there and pray 1 hour. Prayer is, according to evaluators of this movement, one of the three major reasons why the church has grown the way it has. Another is home cell meetings. They now have 52,000 per week! Each consists of 20 minutes of Bible study (along a set curriculum they&#39;ve developed over the years), then 40 minutes of specific prayer for the members of the cell. For each person present, they ask &quot;Is there a problem to be solved, a sickness to be healed, a need to be met?&quot; There are thousands of specialized cells... for women, for men, for doctors and other professionals, for Dads, for Moms, for all. The cells are only allowed to meet for 60 minutes and then, those present can be given 1 cookie each, 1 drink each, then they must immediately be sent on their way. This is Cho&#39;s way of making sure that the rich aren&#39;t guilty of outdoing the poor. The church has 750 full-time pastors. Each is responsible for 7-10 home cells. Thousands more are Deacons and Deaconnesses. To qualify, you must be born again and attend at least 2 services per week of the congregation. In addition, you must attend the equivalent of 4 months in one of the churches 3 seminaries -- and the classes are tough. (One seminary is open 24 hours/day to allow for night classes.) In addition, you must pick a special ministry in the church. 150 buses bring people in each Sunday. They park on ground donated by the city of Seoul, down near the river (several blocks away). To keep people from having to cross busy streets, Cho commissioned a tunnel that allows them to disembark and travel underground directly to the churchhouse basement. Hundreds of deacons get their ministry parking cars.... and some do so for a full 12 hours on each and every Sunday of the year!!! Each first Sunday of the month is communion Sunday. It takes 3000 women to handle the chores. 500 of them are designated just to prepare and cut the bread. They work as full-time volunteers the entire week prior to the service just to get ready. Then after communion, it takes the same 500 women another week just to clean up! They serve 45,000 people communion in under 5 minutes flat. There are 22 &quot;District Pastors&quot; and any one can take over while Cho is traveling worldwide, as he often does. They meet with Cho once per week and Cho tells prospective pastors not to seek the job... unless they realize the level of commitment required. But there is one final reason for the growth, say the researchers. In addition to the prayer and the home cells, they say that Cho&#39;s attitude itself is one of the main reasons for the church&#39;s growth. He never seeks the glory. His humility is known the world around. When the church reached 300,000 in attendance, Cho was beginning to feel overwhelmed. One night he awakened in a cold sweat, unable to sleep. He prayed with all his heart and Cho says he heard God say, &quot;Yonggi Cho, This is not your church. It&#39;s my church. Let me do the worrying.&quot; Cho did exactly that... and has ever since. The vast majority of the church&#39;s members tithe from their gross income (as opposed to &#39;net&#39;). That&#39;s where they get the 100 million dollars. They give millions of it away. They just completed a special air lift of 40 tons of rice to Mongolia (in part, so their missionaries could continue preaching in Mongolia!). They started their own regular newspaper, the People&#39;s Daily News, which now has a circulation of nearly 1 million people. It provides jobs for 600 members (and Cho jokes that some of the reporters are paid better than he is!). Four pages each day are simply gospel message. Each paper contains a complete home/family devotion. Cho believed the old Korean proverb that said that &quot;if you have a pony, you take him to Chejedo [a remote island to the south famous for wild stallions and ponies]; but if you have a son, you take him to Seoul.&quot; Cho believed that the church needed to provide training for Seoul&#39;s sons and daughters who couldn&#39;t otherwise afford college. So they started Elam Welfare Town. Six huge city blocks are spread out today waiting to train thousands of less fortunate youth. They train in skills like auto mechanics, carpentry, etc., and they don&#39;t have to pay a single dime... not for tuition, not for housing, not for food. What&#39;s more, the older folks in the church who have nowhere else to live can come and volunteer at Elam -- and again, pay nothing for room and board until the day they rejoin their Heavenly father. They become surrogate grandparents for hundreds of orphans. And as soon as they graduate, businesspeople in the church snatch them up with new job offers. The college would have cost $30 million -- but it only cost a fraction of that because members of the church helped build the campus as part of their ministry. They just don&#39;t stop. Each month, they send 3 children to the USA for heart surgery -- and they pay for it all with income from huge recycling barrels around the church building. Members bring their used paper and the income is amazing. And they not only recycle paper, they recycle members! For example, just during the last two months of 1992 alone, the church &quot;gave away&quot; 20,000 of its members to start new churches in other locations of Seoul. Cho used to pray an hour a day just so that Seoul would elect a Christian president. Tomorrow (Monday), the conference is going to meet in his church (the churchhouse where the President of Korea worships!). What a change!!! 1/3 of Korea&#39;s population now claims to be Christian. What a change! The story goes on, but you get the idea. An amazing story. An amazing church. An amazing day. The GCOWE delegates met in the evening back at the conference. Highlights included a main session presentation by Bill Bright, Dir. of Campus Crusade. Graham Kendrick (author of &quot;Shine, Jesus Shine!&quot;) sang a song with the GCOWE kids, and Dave Bryant led in a concert of prayer. A highlight included a testimony from a Nepali sister regarding her experience with the growth of the church in Nepal (sent to you as a separate testimony, earlier today). &quot;John&quot; (the piano man, here at GCOWE) did a concert on the pipe organ in the meeting hall -- the largest in pipe organ in all of Asia. Tomorrow (Monday), we&#39;re back in plenary sessions -- but, as mentioned above -- at the church where the President of Korea attends. This is the last day of main sessions together. There are now over 120 subscribers to Brigada-pubs-GCOWENews. And they&#39;ve all subscribed in just over a week&#39;s time! Thanks to all who have joined us... and for those who have sent in notes of encouragement. For example, here&#39;s a note from Alabama, USA: Doug, I want you to know that I&#39;m very pleased and impressed with your reports. God&#39;s power is indeed awesome! I&#39;ve been seriously moved by reading what the lord&#39;s been doing this week in Seoul. As World Missions Director for Madison Presbyterian Church in Huntsville, Alabama, I will be sharing your reports with our congregation tomorrow and praying for you. God bless you and give you strength. Lee Thomas, I-NET, Inc. NASA, Marshall Space Flight Center [end of note from Lee] Thanks for writing, Lee. And thanks for mobilizing your congregation to pray!!! And speaking of prayer, I&#39;d like to ask for special prayer right now... Today, I&#39;ve been sensing a special burden for the fact that there are only four days left of this conference. I&#39;m only one participant -- but as for this participant, I was very concerned about the fact that to me, it seemed we hadn&#39;t been told exactly what part we were all supposed to play in this giant tapestry that is supposed to be called, the AD2000 &amp; Beyond movement. In other words, how will we honestly pull it off.... the goal of &quot;A Church for Every People, and the Gospel for Every Person by the year 2000.&quot; I was feeling that there was no &quot;global master plan.&quot; I was feeling as if it was being left to chance. I was asking myself, &quot;Can it be done by Dec. 31, 2000?&quot; I was answering, &quot;Unless someone spells out a strategy in the next four days, I&#39;m not sure there would be any earthly means. It would be totally in God&#39;s hands.&quot; Then it occurred to me, maybe that&#39;s exactly what the leaders of this conference want us to realize. They&#39;re hoping we&#39;ll take this goal and apply it to our own network, be it country-wide, region-wide, or wider. They&#39;re hoping we&#39;ll carry it to our &#39;track&#39; -- be it &quot;Saturation Evangelism&quot;, &quot;Denominational Leaders&quot;, or whatever. As a result, it feels.... less &quot;organized.&quot; (George Verwer says &quot;Where two or three are gathered together, there you have a mess!&quot;) It feels kind of as if we&#39;re leaving something to chance. On the other hand, the AD2000 &amp; Beyond movement&#39;s leaders are probably asking themselves, &quot;How can we presume to forge a global plan among so many varying participants?&quot; And you know what? They&#39;re probably right. Even if they tried... it probably would never work. Maybe the world is too complex to divide up into a mosaic of people groups and expect various parts to &quot;claim&quot; various segments of the tapestry. Maybe it won&#39;t feel as tidy -- but maybe it&#39;s for the best. ......... And, after all is said and done, maybe they&#39;re thinking that we toss out the bold goal that would be impossible through man&#39;s efforts -- then we all go to our knees knowing that it all depends on God. If God accomplishes it, we will celebrate. But even if He doesn&#39;t, we will still have formed a church that looks more like his prayer in John 17. And maybe that, in and of itself, is worth all the energy invested! So, would you pray with me about these concerns. We&#39;ve only got four days left.... And I just want to make sure we&#39;ve done everything we need to do to prepare for the months ahead. Article source: http://www.ad2000.org/gcowe95/brigada/day5.html",

    "content": "GCOWE &#39;95 Day 4 - May 20, 1995 Doug Lucas GCOWE &#39;95 in Seoul What a finish for the 4th day!!! Seoul Olympic Stadium was absolutely full tonight -- even though the rain poured throughout the entire evening! In front of tens of thousands of Koreans, GCOWE delegates were paraded onto the field like Olympic athletes and were even made to walk the track, wave at the crowd, then were seated in a special section of honor, like heroes! (The real heroes, however, were the Koreans who sat there the whole soggy night through!) 100,000 Korean young men and women were there! And at the end, when the call went out for workers to reach the unreached peoples of the world, everyone stood up! They called it Student Mission 2000. The purpose was to try to recruit 100,000 volunteers for service. The plan was to host a huge sports festival and soccer game starting at 4:00, but, alas, the field was so soggy that the game had to be canceled. (Imagine having prepared for this event for literally months and months, only to have the weather rain you out!) There was to be a Scott Wesly Brown concert -- but again, rain made it very unlikely. But by 6pm, the stadium was packed to hear the three sermons (Sun-Do Kim, George Verwer, and Jung-Kil Hong) and the concert of prayer (would this be the largest concert of prayer in the history of the church???). When the whole thing ended, the 100,000 students said, 2000 years after the birth of Christ, we are here in the Seoul Olympic Main Stadium to dedicate ourselves to Global Evangelism and form a Service Corp for [the] unification of Korea. We are grateful to God for His special blessing upon the Korean Church and the Missionaries who came to bring us the Gospel 110 years ago. We are also grateful to our forefathers for their faith. We have a Mission for [the] Unification of Korea and Global Evangelization. With the 4,662 church leaders from 215 countries who have come here for GCOWE &#39;95, along with many Korean church leaders and the Mothers&#39; Prayer Crusade who has supported us with their prayers, we will dedicate ourselves to the following: We dedicate ourselves to renewing our colleges. We believe the only way to renew our secular colleges can be formed in Jesus Christ. 400,000 Christian students will do their best to proclaim the Gospel to bring unity and to pray. We hope this plan will be accelerated by adopting 8000 colleges by churches all over the world. We dedicate ourselves to serve churches and renewing our churches. We confess that the blessing of God in the Korean Church is diluted with factionalism and secularization. We will be a small flame for total evangelization of Korea and for global evangelization through spiritual repentance and unity of each church. We will carry the burden, as a servant, for the unification of Korea. We will participate positively in acts of love and a sharing movement for [the] unification of Korea. When unification comes, we will spend our time, as individuals in a Service Corps to make a smooth transition for evangelism in North Korea. Besides this, we are concerned that the Korean church will act in rivalry, so we ask the Korean Christians not to be eager in taking advantage of North Koreans and to participate in the sharing movement positively, in the mentality of sacrifice and service. As the &quot;five loaves and two fishes&quot; story, we dedicate ourselves to ask 12 million Korean Christians to collect 120 billion &quot;won&quot; in preparation of [the] unification with North Korea. [&quot;Won&quot; is the local currency. There are 776 &quot;won&quot; to the dollar, making that total well over 150 million dollars!] We dedicate ourselves in the &quot;unreached people&quot; areas of the world. We, 100,000 students of Korea, will dedicate ourselves to evangelization in our various abilities. We will carry the burden of prayer for the cooperation of churches to bring the Gospel and evangelize people all over the world. We are praying that we, 100,000 students, will be a tithe in order that 60,000,000 college students of 8000 colleges all over the world will be evangelized and be resources for Missionary service. We are looking forward to bringing Global Evangelization in our generation. We are praying that just like the Student Volunteer Movement (SVM), consisting of 100,000 students of the past, according to God&#39;s will, that the second SVM will happen before the year 2000. For this, we are suggesting the Student Mission Conference in the year 2000 all Christian students all over the world and all the leaders of the Student Missions will gather for &quot;SM2000&quot;. Through these declarations and activities, we anticipate by faith that the Scripture found in Revelation 7:9-10 will be fulfilled and realized in our generation. &quot;After this I beheld, and, lo, a great multitude, which no man could number, of all nations, and kindreds, and people, and tongues, stood before the throne, and before the Lamb, clothed with white robes, and palms in their hands -- and cried with a loud voice, saying, Salvation to our God which sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb.&quot; May 20, 1995 [end of Seoul Student Declaration] Wow. God was honored this evening. So what else happened today? Well, by morning there were signs posted telling delegates where and when to catch buses for the various venues. Although it seemed at first chaotic, all the &quot;country meetings&quot; seemed to come together. Once again, the format was &quot;presentation, report/case study, small group follow-up or prayer.&quot; Some country meetings apparently tried to get into formation of national strategies, but one consultant reported that it was difficult, at best. &quot;These delegates are coming from all different levels of Christian maturity,&quot; reported the consultant. &quot;Some are ready for strategy questions, whereas others are experiencing missions and world evangelism themes for the first time in their Christian lives! In some ways, talking with such a mixed group about national strategies to reach the unreached is, well, frankly, a waste of time!&quot; Maybe it takes a day or two to warm up the groups. The Tracks, the Country meetings, (and regional meetings) will all meet again next week. The jury&#39;s still out on whether anything tangible will come of those sessions. But from the anecdotal reports we&#39;ve heard so far, the meetings until now are somewhat of a disappointment. However, with tonight&#39;s tremendous (though soggy) finish on another long day, everyone is charged up for worship tomorrow (Sunday). Many are said to be planning to attend the Pastor Cho&#39;s Full Gospel Church, said to be the largest congregation in the world. (Lord willing, that&#39;s where I hope to go.) Believe it or not, I don&#39;t think anything is scheduled for the afternoon. However, Korean arrangements committees have matched many foreign delegations with a &quot;sister church&quot; who will be hosting that delegation for worship, lunch, and (I&#39;m sure), fellowship. So it could still be a long afternoon for many. There is a plenary worship tomorrow evening back at Torch Center. Did I mention the Queen of Lesotho is here as a delegate??? Queen Tabitha Mamohato. I guess I should start a &quot;Did You Know&quot; section??? [grin] DID YOU KNOW... ...The Queen of Lesotho is here as a delegate? (What&#39;s that? Old news, eh?) (Well what about this?)... the GCOWE Journal(the daily &quot;newspaper&quot; being distributed here to delegates) is being led by none other than David Aikman, whose stories have been carried throughout the past few years by Timeand other magazines. He covered (for Time) Israel&#39;s occupation of Lebanon, the war in Vietnam, the massacres in Cambodia, Tiananmen Square (he was an eyewitness to the slaughter), and the Persian Gulf War! And here he is doing volunteer work, editing the GCOWE Journal! As they become available, we&#39;ll try to place GCOWE Journal articles in the file area here on Brigada-pubs-gcowenews. (You probably caught the announcement earlier about the file names just placed there today (by my partner, Dave), but if you&#39;d like to see a fresh list just send email to hub@xc.org with only the following line in the body of the text: filelist brigada-pubs-gcowenews And speaking of the GCOWE Journal, tonight&#39;s edition carried an entire page of information about Brigada (the newspaper is printed on huge newsprint pages -- so a full page is a lot!). They literally profiled each and every Brigada conference and gave full instructions as to how to subscribe. Gulp. Yikes. Anyone out there willing to help moderate???? [grin] We still need moderators for the following conferences: brigada-prayer-mobilizers, brigada-projects-security, brigada-cities, brigada-peoples, brigada-ukraine-crimea. If you have a basic willingness to consider it, but want more information about what would be involved, write DougLucas@xc.org for info. and suggest which conference you might consider helping. Thanks! Thanks to those who caught my prayer request yesterday (&quot;By the way, pray for me as I try to discern how I should or could be involved in advocating for a couple of &quot;minimum toolbox outcomes.&quot;) This morning, I happened to see Luis Bush for the first time in the hall outside the press room (heading to a TV interview). Mr. Bush is the International Director of the AD2000 &amp; Beyond movement. I don&#39;t think it was a coincidence that this was the first time I had seen him off the main stage! He took time to listen to my concerns about how to strategize and track people group &quot;adoptions&quot; and let me know that it was a very high priority on his mind. (Good thing; he has written that the success of the AD2000 &amp; Beyond movement will be judged by whether or not it is successful in planting new church movements among the some 2500 unreached peoples in the PIN &quot;Key List of Priority Least Evangelized Peoples for the AD 2000 &amp; Beyond Movement&quot;, published here (by PIN) for the first time.) Mr. Bush made a couple of very key suggestions, which we hope to follow up on in meetings tomorrow with key leaders at 4pm and again at 5pm local time (Sunday). Would you join me in praying that those meetings will go well and that God&#39;s will would be done? Further details should probably wait on outcomes from those meetings. So, the sun has set on another day in Seoul. (Actually, I don&#39;t we ever even saw the sun today!) As the day draws to its close (it&#39;s nearly midnight here, Sat. evening), we&#39;re once again mindful of the 1000 Korean young adults who have volunteered for service to make this convention possible. They once again have shown their energy and fortitude in magnificent ways (standing out in the rain tonight). It seems their smiles and warmth are endless. They truly have been a highlight to this experience thus far. Tonight, here in our hotel room, my room-mates and I thanked the Lord for those angels in &quot;yellow flack jackets&quot; -- may God bless them mightily with energy now, rest afterward, and blessings forever!

    "content": "GCOWE &#39;95 Day 3 - May 19, 1995 Doug Lucas GCOWE &#39;95 in Seoul Tracks, tracks and more tracks! That&#39;s what happened today. And for the second day in a row, sessions went once again from 9am to 9pm. (By the way, don&#39;t forget to add 90 minutes on the front and the back for bus time!) Still, there was seemingly a high degree of participation in the program. Still, I suspect that after another 9am - 9pm schedule (tomorrow), none of the 4000 delegates or volunteers would protest a day of rest! Yesterday we mentioned the tracks by name... and there&#39;s no way one could possibly attend all or even most of them! Each track was self-contained, often with worship and prayer times built in. It appeared that track coordinators had focused heavily on designing a program that would alternate between lecture presentations (the macro) and small group discussions (the micro). For example, in the Unreached Peoples Track, a presenter would share some basic information, interview a majority world person employing that particular approach or espousing that particular position, then move the audience into a &quot;brainstorming mode&quot; prior wrapping up the component with a debriefing from the small groups. Honest.... this approach tends to keep audience involvement and help everyone feel included. But frankly, if we evaluate pure work output, as one delegate put it, we&#39;re not totally convinced that it results in the most raw &quot;horsepower.&quot; I don&#39;t think many of us came here to be inspired. We already believe in this cause. We need resources. We want tools. And if we&#39;re going to pull off this whole &quot;church for every people&quot; thing in 5 years, we need them now. We can&#39;t wait for follow-up consultations or 1996. This is the place. Now is the time. (By the way, pray for me as I try to discern how I should or could be involved in advocating for a couple of &quot;minimum toolbox outcomes.&quot;) The Denominational Leaders Track serves as another example of the above format. A speaker like Bob Bakke would share his opinion about the importance of prayer for world evangelism. Then we would break up into table groups to brainstorm about how we could implement those ideas in our own contexts. On the surface, it sounds good. But in reality, if you happen to be sitting at a table with people who either a) already believe in prayer and are practicing it with a passion, or b) have no idea what to suggest to implement it on macro levels,... then it seems things just don&#39;t move as quickly as you&#39;d like. We heard great things from the Mobilizing New Missionaries Track. George Verwer evidently gave quite a presentation. I think we all find ourselves wondering if maybe we were in the right place today. One man said that he had split the time between two meetings in adjacent rooms, just because he didn&#39;t want to miss anything from either track. I think when it&#39;s over, there will be many who wish they could purchase a synopsis from all Tracks or even just a few. Unfortunately, I don&#39;t think anyone has planned a mechanism for that possibility. If they have, no one is mentioning it... and I sure don&#39;t see anyone taking feverish notes or recording sessions. One thing is for sure -- the challenge of the logistics of managing this many people continue to be painfully obvious. For example, many Tracks apparently contained upwards of 200 - 300 peoples attending. And since there was no hall in the city with enough rooms to handle that many &quot;sub-meetings&quot;, it meant splitting the Tracks up in different parts of the city. Tomorrow, with more divisions, it gets even worse. Instead of a dozen or so medium-sized sub-conferences, we could easily have over a hundred even smaller group meetings, needing even smaller meeting places. As a result, the venues are up to an hour or more apart, making it very difficult to plan for transport. The truth is, it appears no one is really sure how they&#39;ll get to their venues tomorrow... and to be honest, it&#39;s not real clear where we&#39;re supposed to go! The meeting places unfortunately weren&#39;t included in the main consultation &quot;handbook&quot; and to my knowledge, no one announced them today (since we were split up without any &quot;plenary&quot; [main] session). I can&#39;t help but feel sorry for some of the delegates from the majority world, where the pace might not normally be so fast and the normal daily routine might not normally require so much investigative determination! Actually, it&#39;s midnight and there&#39;s not a &quot;sign of a sign&quot; anywhere in this hotel (if it&#39;s a representative sampling -- at least I know that pretty much all the American delegation is here) telling us where we meet and what time the bus would come (if one is coming) to take us there.... So maybe this is a good experience... a chance to practice tolerance of ambiguity. I can sure deal with it... but I hope everyone else feels the same way, especially in light of the daily conference expenses which average out to about $200 per day or more. So with all the complexity, we&#39;ve all sure come to appreciate the 1000 Korean volunteers in those yellow hunting vests! (They really do look like yellow hunting vests, though they&#39;re covered with AD2000 logos and watchwords.) Like other Eastern people that you might have known, these folks appear to be some of the most hospitable people in the world. Their warm smiles and kind graciousness seem to be able to wash away any amount of desperation... so far. So to all the Koreans who are helping to plan and implement, THANKS! I mentioned yesterday that some of the most helpful times are the moments between sessions when you meet someone inspirational. Take a pastor freidn from Thailand for example. Bumped into him yesterday waiting for the elevator. Turns out he&#39;s been a pastor in Bangkok for most of his life, though he has never been willing to accept pay. He just concentrates on meeting needs... and keeps his part-time job at the university. So what&#39;s he been doing in his spare time? Well, his church, the City of Hope, decided they&#39;d try to practice Christianity just the same way as the churches in the New Testament. They came up with several criteria that they would press for in the lives of their members.. and if no one met the criteria, they simply kept working with them prior to asking them to become a formal part of the movement through baptism. He preaches mostly expository sermons... exhorting his people to get right back to the &quot;Book&quot;. They determined to intentionally avoid formal ties with any particular denomination, since it didn&#39;t appear that that was a New Testament concept. At the same time, they gave lots of flexibility where there was no biblically-stated policy for approaches.. Is it working? You decide. They&#39;ve grown from one church to 250 congregations.... from an average attendance of a few hundred to a grand total of 3500 at any given service... and there are 5 services each Sunday . ... and that&#39;s just the mother church alone!!! The guy preaches to some 13,000 people per week... in Bangkok!!! Plus they&#39;ve started 30 congregations outside of the country with missionaries working cross-culturally. Remember, all this time, he has been totally self-supporting. These days, he oversees a staff of 200 full-time (paid) workers and keeps on going for study-time, family and his teaching job. He said, &quot;We believe in starting a church without all the trappings. We get no support from the outside. We&#39;re on our own... on a shoe string budget... doing the work of the Lord. When we train a new church planter, we make it clear that we&#39;ll give him no financial assistance for the building or for any fancy approaches. It&#39;s all very personal and low-key.&quot; Wow. Now there&#39;s the kind of guy you wish you could just spend a day with in Bangkok planning and dreaming for the future! Yikes. What time do I set the alarm clock for? [grin] Better go try to find out. Have a great day! Article source: http://www.ad2000.org/gcowe95/brigada/day3.html",

    "title": "GCOWE '95 Day 2: Report by Brigada",
    "content": "GCOWE &#39;95 Day 2 - May 18, 1995 Doug Lucas GCOWE &#39;95 in Seoul A LIST -- Wow. A list. But not the&lt;/em&gt; list. Day 2 at GCOWE &#39;95 started with the Unreached People Group Track&#39;s plenary presentation (all 4000 delegates together). After premiering a dynamite 11 minute video on the challenge remaining before us, Track Chairman Patrick Johnstone (author of Operation World) explained the progress the group had made toward agreeing upon a list of unreached peoples. The list, which was distributed to each delegate at registration, is actually a book of several lists... but perhaps the most important of all is a key list of 2400 &quot;least evangelized peoples&quot; that were presented as the proposed list of target groups for measuring &quot;a church for every people&quot; by the year 2000. What does this mean in practical terms? The truth is, for several years, various researchers have had trouble agreeing on a common definition for &quot;people group.&quot; In a pre-GCOWE planning meeting last November, it is said that all the key players finally settled on a common definition.... an ethnolinguistic one. According to Johnstone&#39;s talk, there are 12- or 13,000 ethnolinguistic groups in the world today and presumably all but 2500 or so already have a church (at least a beachhead church) in their midst. The AD2000 &amp; Beyond challenge then -- a church for every people -- would demand that we at least approach these 2500 people groups with the gospel. Even in cases where there might already be some worker on-site sharing about Christ, we would, according to the proposed goal, need to invest more energy to insure that a church actually formed. This, then, begins to enlighten all of us to the real differences between the Lausanne movement and AD2000 &amp; Beyond. Some would say that the Lausanne movement peaked at the 1974 conference in Lausanne, Switzerland, where Ralph Winter literally coined the term, &quot;people group&quot;. Throughout the next 15 years, Lausanne tried to inform and challenge, but never to actually take intentional part in shaping practical over-arching strategies. Enter AD 2000 &amp; Beyond. The strategy simply cannot be missed here. The purpose of this consultation is to figure out how we can make sure that by Dec. 31, 2000 (the end of the 2nd millennium), there is at least some kind of church planted in every one of those 2500 groups. That&#39;s how AD2000 leaders will measure whether they&#39;ve succeeded or failed. That&#39;s the yardstick. In the end, for the purpose of measuring success, it won&#39;t matter how much growth has occurred in any currently existing churches. What will matter is the outcome among the 2500 groups. So there&#39;s the mandate... and it appeared the entire consultation is on board. Even if some haven&#39;t processed the real &quot;bottom line&quot;, it won&#39;t take long for it to sink in. Every article, every review, every publication from AD2000 &amp; Beyond for the next five years -- if it is true to the spirit of the AD2000 &amp; Beyond movement [note the significant small &quot;m&quot;] -- will be trying to help us stay on task to reach those peoples. Now granted... in the hallways and on the steps, participants were asking, &quot;Hey! Look at group they left out! [fill in the blank with your own favorite]&quot; But as Pete Holzmann put it afterward, in one of the hallway conversations after the main session, &quot;that list is a moving target and we&#39;re on a moving platform!&quot; First, the list itself is &quot;moving&quot; in that we will hopefully learn more about each people group as researchers and on-site teams visit and report on outreaches to some of the 2500 groups (and stay tuned to Brigada as one source for those reports!). Second, we&#39;re on a moving platform since we&#39;re learning more about how to describe them and how to integrate/sort them. So don&#39;t take this list as &quot;Biblical&quot; (Johnstone&#39;s own terms) -- it will definitely be updated! John Robb finished the presentation by interviewing a half dozen majority world participants who were already at work pioneering a church planting movment among some unreached people somewhere in the world. Also making presentations today were the Mobilizing National Research Track, the God&#39;s Word and Literature Network, Saturation Evangelism, Saturation Church Planting, the Partnership Task Force, the Radio/Video track, and the United Prayer Track. Sessions started at 9am this morning, with the bus leaving the hotel at 7:40am. The program ended at 9:15pm and tonight buses arrived in hotels an hour later (much better than last night!). THE MAGIC OF CONSULATIONS -- As I watched the conference today, I took note of all the private conversations in the work rooms, at the lunch tables, in the auditorium after sessions, and basically everywhere else 4000 people can go! Truthfully, in spite of the extremely high quality content in the main sessions, I&#39;m beginning to wonder if maybe the real gain from this consultation (and maybe most others?) is the networking that occurs every minute of the day during the times we aren&#39;t meeting... because so many caring and gifted people are coming together with a willingness to help others get going. So in summary, join me in thanking God that it appears we have made some progress on coming to grips with the task remaining. It really doesn&#39;t bring the task any closer, but it&#39;s perhaps a first step in figuring out our eventual destination... assuming our destination is &quot;AD2000&quot;. Tomorrow, the entire conference splits into a dozen or so different &quot;tracks&quot; or working groups: In addition to those mentioned above (Unreached Peoples, Mobilizing National Research, God&#39;s Word and Literature, Saturation Evangelism, Saturation Church Planting, the Radio/Video, United Prayer and the task force on Partnership Development), also meeting will be tracks on Denominational Leaders, Cities, Pastors&#39;, Mobilizing Women, and Mobilizing New Missionaries. Furthermore, there are a few other separate Task Forces that will be meeting simultaneously, such as a special task force on producing strategies, outreach to Muslims, etc. It seems there is more time given for these small groups sessions at this consultation than there was, say, at Lausanne II in Manila. In fact, except for more main plenary sessions on Monday, the only other time the consultation meets all together again after today is for the closing program on the evening of the 25th! In tomorrow&#39;s GCOWE News, we&#39;ll tell about some of the people who are making this conference special. Some are high profile, like John Robb, Phill Butler and Patrick Johnstone. Others, however, are effective &quot;behind the scenes&quot; workers like Pete Holzmann, the many volunteers from around the world, and the 1000+ Korean helpers! Finally, let&#39;s not forget what we can learn from fellow delegates. Tomorrow we&#39;ll illustrate with the life of a pastor from Thailand. Wait until you hear his story!

    "title": "GCOWE '95 Day 1: Report by Brigada",
    "content": "GCOWE &#39;95 Day 1 - May 17, 1995 Doug Lucas GCOWE &#39;95 Well, it&#39;s 11:30pm on Wed. evening, May 17, the close of Day 1 at the GCOWE &#39;95. Registration went so smoothly and quickly, it was hardly believable! (For those who attended Lausanne II in Manila, forget the long lines! These volunteers an AD2000 &amp; Beyond staff people had this registration thing down to a science 5 minutes tops! No wait! And there are over 4000 of us here!) The meeting opened today with group worship in the Torch Center, a building built (or more accurately, a campus!) by the Koreans with the hope of spurring along world missions mobilization! The Torch Center is a kind of US Center for World Mission a la Seoul.... bigger, more beautiful, and more spacious. Nearly 4000 people fit in the main auditorium! The Koreans gave the GCOWE delegates a very warm welcome in the form of a &quot;Cultural Pageant&quot; (presented by the AD2000 &amp; Beyond Movement&#39;s Korean Women&#39;s Track. The Opening Greeting by Mrs. [Dr.] Hung-Ja Lee (Vice Pres. of the Korean Preparation Committee and Chairperson of the Korean Women&#39;s Track Committee) said through an interpreter, &quot;There has never been, in the history of the Christian Church, a time when more than two hundred nations were represented at one place as here today. We represent practically every nation, people, culture, and language.&quot; Following this opening greeting, the Koreans presented a special interpretive performance entitled, &quot;Go!&quot;, complete with full orchestral accompaniment and expressive Korean traditional dance. The memorable performance included scenes from the Gospel of Luke -- crucifixion, suffering, resurrection, appearance to the 12, and sending out the disciples for missions to the nations. A heart applause rounded out this segment of the envent. Next came specials in song, featuring Korean traditional music from the Kayagum (a traditional Korean music instrument) and later more instrumental presentations by the &quot;Piri&quot; (another Korean folk instrument). The &quot;Worship Taekwondo&quot; was one of the most unique expressions of worship ever! The marshall arts drills were set to Christian music, and the presenters gave all the glory for their skills to the Lord. The multi-media slide program was probably the only major disappointment. Technical difficulties marred the completion of what must have been literally hundreds and maybe thousands of slides from all over the world, presented by dissolving projectors from the balcony onto the giant screen in front. And when they did get everything working again, the combined women&#39;s choir was already in position to sing... so the group never got to see the slides. Thomas Wang then presented the first plenary address. His message was entitled &quot;A Small Cloud -- A Great Rain&quot; and was taken from I Kings 18, where Elijah just won&#39;t give up praying for rain... and from the tiniest rain cloud (in the &quot;sharpen of a man&#39;s hand&quot;, God brings a great thundering rain to bless the ground.&quot; Wang considered the fullness in the torch center as the beginning of the sounds of thundering rain! (The full message of his text can be found on this conference, brigada-pubs-gcowenews, under filename Wang0517.txt.) During the evening session, Louis Bush spoke on the Unfinished Task -- &quot;It Can be Done, It Ought to be Done, It Must be Done.&quot; For each of his 3 major topics (see title), he brought case studies from the audience to illiterates his point. (The full message of his text) can be found on this conference, brigada-pubs-gcowenews, under filename Bush0517.txt.) Sessions ended 30 minutes early, at 8:30am. However, loading up buses took an addition 3 hours!!! So we didn&#39;t make it back to the hotal room until very late. Tomorrow&#39;s =very= long day consists of total plenary sessions. Yikes. If we don&#39;t like sitting still, it&#39;ll be a challenge! Article source: http://www.ad2000.org/gcowe95/brigada/day1.html",

    "title": "GCOWE '95 Delegates' Welcome: Report by Brigada",
    "content": "GCOWE &#39;95 Delegates&#39; Welcome: Report by Brigada Dear GCOWE Participant, Welcome to GCOWE &#39;95, the AD 2000 mid-decadal strategy consultation in Korea! We rejoice that you have come to participate in this historic event, whose theme is &quot;a church for every people and the gospel for every person by AD 2000.&quot; We have come to Seoul from all parts of the world_some 200 countries! We meet together at a momentous time in history, five years from the end of the decade, the transition into a new century and millennial, the year 2000... which for centuries has been a universal symbol of the future. It&#39;s a time when we see God on the move among His people throughout the world perhaps as never before in all of history. It is a time of unprecedented global divine initiative. It is unprecedented we have never seen anything like it before. It is global worldwide. It is divine from God and through God and to God. It is an initiative, indeed, God is moving. We wait expectantly for an outpouring of His Spirit. Our purpose in GCOWE &#39;95 is to encourage continued momentum building toward the fulfillment of the goal of a church for every people and the gospel for every person by the year 2000. An underlying assumption as we come to GCOWE &#39;95 is a continuing divine superintending of global events of such import that it is moving us from an age of unbelief to an age of faith as we approach the year 2000. The explosive growth of the Two Thirds World church in this century has positioned the church around the world for a major evangelistic thrust in the nineties. Many church and mission leaders now believe that genuine collaborative partnerships are the only way to take advantage of the opportunities presented in this last decade of the millennium. Increased momentum building toward world evangelization is anticipated and prayerfully sought as a result of GCOWE &#39;95. Many groups within the body of Christ, individually and collectively, will set or revise their own year 2000 goals for world evangelization during their time here. Paving the road to this global event are the more than 100 national, regional, and functional AD2000 consultations that have been held around the world over the last few years. GCOWE &#39;95 is unique, in that the majority of the participants (about two-thirds) will come from Africa, Asia and Latin America. It marks a paradigm shift of the ownership of world evangelization in that much of the funding (about 75%) will come from these locations. The Korean church is not only hosting the event but graciously providing by faith for most in-country expenses for participants from poorer economic nations. Please join with us as we thank all our friends in Korea for graciously preparing and hosting us for this historic gathering! By prayerful intent, this movement and event is grass-roots and low expense oriented. Thus, most of the participants are housed in missionary lifestyle quarters, including Westerners. We hope that after some rest you will be refreshed and ready to enter enthusiastically into the next ten days. We have a strategic opportunity before us and we must fully use it for Christ in these days and the next five years. &quot;And this gospel of the Kingdom will be preached in the whole world as a testimony to all nations and then the end will come.&quot; (Matt. 24:14) Luis Bush Thomas Wang Kim Joon Gon Article source: http://www.ad2000.org/gcowe95/brigada/welcome-letter.html",

    "title": "The Unfinished Task It Can Be Done By AD 2000",
    "content": "The Unfinished Task It Can Be Done By AD 2000 Today, nearly two thousand years after Christ challenged his disciples with the Great Commission, the Church which bears His name approaches a milestone many had only dreamed of reaching. A goal which has ignited the hearts of missionaries for centuries now stands within sight. That goal? &quot;A church for every people and the Gospel for every person.&quot; This is the &quot;The Unfinished Task.&quot; It is the goal of the AD 2000 &amp; Beyond Movement -- not only that the task be done, but that it be done by the end of the millennium -- by December 31, 2000. Do you wonder if the scope of such a task sounds too far- reaching? Then consider this. It isn&#39;t too far-reaching for the Coca- Cola Corporation. They&#39;ve vowed to place &quot;A Coke in the hand of every person on earth by the year 2000.&quot; If such a goal can be credibly announced by the marketers of a soft drink, how can we shrink from reaching that same world, in the same time frame, with the saving Gospel of Jesus Christ? The goal is in sight! One hundred years ago, evangelist D. L. Moody said concerning the evangelization of the world by the end of 1900, &quot;It can be done, it ought to be done, it must be done.&quot; However, some five years before the end of the century, his colleague A.T. Pierson would admit, &quot;We despaired of hope.&quot; Today, some five years before the end of this century and millennium, hope and anticipation have replaced the despair of a former time. The goal of &quot;a church for every people and the Gospel for every person by the year 2000&quot; has united over 4000 Christian leaders from more than 180 countries of the world. It&#39;s a goal each individual has already committed to in writing. It&#39;s a goal which has called them together for the Global Consultation on World Evangelization (GCOWE &#39;95) in Seoul, Korea in May 1995. Ralph Winter, founder of the U.S. Center for World Mission, says of GCOWE &#39;95, &quot;The AD 2000 face-to-face global meeting in Korea may be the most strategic Christian gathering in history.&quot; Why do so many of God&#39;s servants in so many countries believe &quot;The Unfinished Task&quot; can be done? Why ought the task be done? What must be done now? It Can Be Done! When we look at the advance of God&#39;s kingdom, the great portion of the task has already been done. Current expectations state that by the year 2000, over 95% of the population of the world -- people from every culture and language and country -- will have access to the Gospel through a portion of Scripture in their own language, literature distribution, radio transmission, audio recordings, the &quot;Jesus&quot; film, or through the preaching of an evangelist. By one means or another, the world will be exposed to the Gospel. Furthermore, access to the Gospel is not simply a matter of one means or another, but one means and others. In other words, the year 2000 will witness over 95% of the world&#39;s population having access not only to a Scripture portion in their language, but also to Christian radio transmission, and audio recordings, and the &quot;Jesus&quot; film. The Gospel for every person is truly possible! When we examine the feasibility of planting &quot;a church for every people,&quot; we again see that a great portion of the task has already been done. That&#39;s because of the 12,000 known ethno-linguistic peoples in the world, 10,000 already have a church planting movement in their midst! Looking back at what the Lord has done, we can only say, &quot;Praise be to God!&quot; And we honor and thank His many servants who have gone before -- servants upon whose shoulders we stand at this great moment of divine initiative. &quot;The Unfinished Task&quot; remaining is but a small portion! But the evidence continues far beyond merely the extent of what&#39;s already been accomplished. We also see evidence of a rapid acceleration in divine activity toward the fulfillment of the goal. Through His people, God is completing the task more quickly than ever before. Operation World British author Patrick Johnstone, Chairman of the AD 2000 Unreached Peoples Network, assesses both aspects of the goal when he writes, &quot;There is cause for much praise to God in the progress over the past 200 years, and more especially in the past 30, and cautious hope for the initial attainment of our goals.&quot; It Can Be Done! Because Of Prayer Mobilization The many promises in God&#39;s Word concerning answered prayer underscore the pivotal role of a growing prayer movement focused on world evangelization. After all, it was J. Edwin Orr, the student of revival, who said, &quot;When God is about to do something new he sets His people a- praying.&quot; The title of a three-page article in the November 14, 1994 edition of Christianity Today posed the following question: &quot;Is a Global Great Awakening Just Around the Corner?&quot; The answer comes in the first paragraph: &quot;With millions of Christian believers holding mass prayer rallies worldwide, scholars and prayer movement leaders are asking whether this development foreshadows church renewal on a global scale.&quot; The article cites as examples prayer initiatives such as the Day to Change the World held the 25th of June, 1994 and the October 1993 Praying Through the Window, organized by the AD 2000 Prayer Mobilization Network led by Peter Wagner. The article further proclaims that, &quot;A prayer movement that greatly surpasses anything, perhaps in all of Christian history, is rapidly gaining momentum.&quot; This prayer momentum keeps growing! Praying Through the Window II, scheduled for October 1995, is focused on the Major Gateway (influential) Cities of the 10/40 Window. Thirty to fifty million Christians and 10,000 on-site intercessors in 400 teams are expected to participate in this event. It Can Be Done! Because Of Accelerated Outreach Efforts &quot;The Gospel for every person&quot; means that every person on earth will have access to the good news of Jesus Christ. What evidence points to such worldwide Gospel access becoming a reality? First, the gospel for every person by the year 2000 can become a reality via the impact of television and a believable preacher. Consider the ministry of just one evangelist -- in fact, a man who is honorary co-chairman of this movement. Since his 1949 Los Angeles crusade, Billy Graham has preached to live audiences numbering over 180 million people, in more than 180 countries and territories. Yet, the impact of a single day in March 1995 dwarfs even that lifetime&#39;s exposure -- the simultaneous broadcast of Graham&#39;s message from Hiram Bithorn Stadium in San Juan, Puerto Rico to 165 nations of the world. This one event will expose more people to the Gospel than all the combined audiences in Billy Graham&#39;s years of ministry up to two years ago. In fact, never before in history have so many people, estimated in excess of one billion souls, heard the Gospel in a single day! We&#39;re seeing today&#39;s technology and one evangelist&#39;s credibility combine to expose more than 20% of the world&#39;s population -- in one day -- to a powerful gospel message! Second, the gospel for every person by the year 2000 can become a reality because the Scriptures are available in the languages of the people. By the year 2000, eight out of ten people will have access to the entire Bible in their language and nine out of ten to a New Testament. The acceleration in Bible translation is so remarkable that today more than eighteen portions are translated a year -- compared to just over three a year in 1900. Third, the gospel for every person by the year 2000 can become a reality because of massive literature distribution both systematically to every home and randomly throughout the world. Dick Eastman, coordinator of the AD 2000 God&#39;s Word and Literature Network, is systematically working to distribute Christian literature to every home in the world. In India, with a population approaching one billion by the year 2000, Final Thrust 5000 works with other agencies to distribute Christian literature to every home in the more than 600,000 villages by century&#39;s end. An average of seventeen churches per day are currently being planted. Eastman attributes the increased response in India and globally in 1993 and 1994 to the October 1993 Praying Through the Window initiative. Fourth, the gospel for every person by the year 2000 can become a reality because of audio communications. This category encompasses all radio and recorded Gospel messages on audio cassettes, as well as other media which do not require reading skills for comprehension. The United Nations calls the 1980&#39;s &quot;The Lost Decade&quot; because of a dramatic rise in illiteracy. Many of the reported unreached peoples number among these illiterate -- estimated today at close to two billion individuals. Audio communication has emerged as the obvious and vital mass medium for reaching these people. Since the establishment in 1985 of the radio broadcasting coalition called World by 2000, we&#39;ve witnessed a dramatic acceleration of the Gospel&#39;s availability in new languages on radio. In less than ten years, the number of languages broadcast has increased from 170 to 249. By the year 2000, radio broadcasts are expected to cover 97% of the world&#39;s population. The AD 2000 Audio Communications Network, with the involvement of more than 20 agencies, seeks through Target 4000 to help recruit a minimum of 70 recording teams to finish the cassette recording work. This cooperative effort exemplifies the spirit and method of the AD 2000 &amp; Beyond Movement. The Gospel Recordings agency only began their work in 1940, yet by the year 2000, audio recordings will be accessible to 96% of the human race. (Note: The number of languages varies on the charts due to differences in definition. The Bible Translation chart reflects the known languages definitely requiring translation. The Christian Radio Broadcasting chart uses language to designate a broadcasted language understood across various dialects.) Fifth, the gospel for every person by the year 2000 can become a reality because of the &quot;Jesus&quot; film. Over one-half billion people have seen this thrilling film in 216 countries of the world, with 75 million people registering decisions for Christ -- about 10,000 per day. 421 different denominations and Christian organizations are involved. A translation is being completed every 10 days. The goal, by the year 2000, is that the &quot;Jesus&quot; film will be available in languages understood by 99% of the world&#39;s population. It Ought To Be Done! The Bible provides the directive that &quot;The Unfinished Task&quot; of &quot;a church for every people and the Gospel for every person&quot; ought to be done. Jesus said, &quot;If you love me, you will obey what I command&quot; (John 14:15). When Jesus gave The Great Commission to His followers, He commanded them to &quot;Go and make disciples of all nations&quot; (Matthew 28:19). The word used here for &quot;nations&quot; is &quot;ethne,&quot; which more closely means &quot;ethno-linguistic peoples&quot; rather than the present-day word &quot;nations&quot; (that is, countries with politically drawn boundaries). Church planting efforts must target unreached ethno-linguistic peoples. The Bible records that representatives from every ethno-linguistic people will be in heaven. John wrote in Revelation 7:9, &quot;After this I looked and there before me was a great multitude that no one could count, from every nation, tribe, people and language, standing before the throne and in front of the Lamb. They were wearing white robes and were holding palm branches in their hands.&quot; In addition to reaching people groups, Scripture also stresses the need for every person to hear the Gospel message. In the commissioning of His followers, Jesus said, &quot;Go into all the world and preach the good news to all creation&quot; (Mark 16:15). These verses have led the AD 2000 &amp; Beyond Movement to assess the task remaining and mobilize Christians worldwide -- to bring each ethno-linguistic people group a church and each person access to the Gospel message. It Must Be Done! After seeing that &quot;The Unfinished Task&quot; can be done and ought to be done, we now realize it must be done. But what must be done to achieve the vision of &quot;a church for every people and the Gospel for every person by the year 2000&quot;? How can this goal be accomplished? The AD 2000 and Beyond Movement has assembled many excellent strategies for completing the task. These include countrywide efforts, denominational initiatives, regionwide projects, citywide programs, networks of agencies, and partnerships between organizations who labor together toward the year 2000. &quot;The Unfinished Task&quot; among unreached peoples has become a focus for all of them. Over 2000 plans targeting the year 2000 have emerged independently, in country after country around the world, and are indicators of what we must do in the years to come. We must acknowledge these plans. We must support them. We must get behind them. There may be gaps to fill. There may be areas we can enrich. The Apostle Paul reminds us to run the race to obtain the prize. By God&#39;s grace and provision, we have come a long way. We are getting close to the end of the race. It is time to quicken our pace. It is time to begin our sprint. Paul said to the Romans, &quot;The hour has come for you to wake up from your slumber, because our salvation is nearer now than when we first believed. The night is nearly over; the day is almost here&quot; (Romans 13:11-12). Several valid concerns exist regarding &quot;The Unfinished Task. &quot; We must not oversimplify the scope of the work ahead. We must guard against a failure to cooperate adequately among the Body of Christ. We should not underestimate the human, spiritual and financial costs of reaching the world&#39;s remaining unevangelized people in the short time ahead. But God is on the move! God is superintending the events of our time. He is the source of humanity&#39;s growing spiritual thirst. Now is the time. Let us go forward with God&#39;s help and join together in harmony as we work toward the year 2000 and beyond, to complete &quot;The Unfinished Task.&quot; It can be done!

    "title": "An Update from the Mission Mobilization Resource Network of Mission America 2000",
    "content": "An Update from the Mission Mobilization Resource Network of Mission America 2000 Mission Frontiers In conjunction with the previous article, the following is a short interview with Dave Imboden, USCWM Regional Offices Coordinator and Co-coordinator for the Mission Mobilization Resource Network of Mission America 2000. MF: What role does the USCWM have in the Mission America 2000 campaign? Dave: The MA2000 campaign has five dimensions: 1) Prayer, 2) Evangelism, 3) Research, 4) Racial Reconciliation and 5) Mission Mobilization. The USCWM has already been participating in and assisting the Mission Mobilization Resource Network (MMRN) (see MF Jan/Feb &#39;94) which was created through the impetus of Luis Bush and an AD2000 and Beyond pre-consultation for the U.S., held August, 1992. The MMRN has already begun to play a key role in the development of mission mobilization for the MA2000 campaign, having participated in a national Citywide Strategies &quot;kick off&quot; meeting for MA2000 in Pittsburgh, August 25-28. MF: What exactly is the MMRN planning to do through MA2000? Dave: A strategy session at the Pittsburgh meeting resulted in the following declaration: The MMRN will begin to, or in some cases, already has begun to: connect existing mission mobilization networkers and ministries with other MA2000 networkers within cities pray for networkers to be raised up in every targeted city as well as sections of the three mega-cities, N.Y.C., L.A. and Chicago promote existing transdenominational mobilization ministries and resources from ACMC, ACMI, AIMS, Caleb Resources and the USCWM as MA2000 resources encourage area reps (from ministries mentioned in #3) to prayerfully pursue becoming networkers for their cities complete a revised mission mobilizer&#39;s handbook on key tools, ministries and networks for helping local churches and fellowships to do mission provide an annual national consultation on mission mobilization in conjunction with the national ACMC conference. MF: What other significant developments occurred as a result of meeting in Pittsburgh? Dave: Due largely to the presence of David Ripley, SIM&#39;s National Director of Ethnic Focus Ministry, much discussion in our strategy group surrounded the need for vision and training for local churches to pursue cross-cultural outreach and church planting. The need for this kind of training is due to the multi-ethnic realities that exist throughout American cities. Because local neighborhood evangelism will be taking place throughout entire cities there will be many encounters with different cultures. Also, most Christians from any significant size city today have a good chance of working with, going to school with, or living next to someone from another culture. These are opportunities that MA2000 will certainly want to pursue via friendship evangelism and the use of tools like the Jesus video. Another critical issue that surfaced during our discussion and related to the above issue is the need for demographic and ethnographic studies. SIM is an example of an agency already doing work with local churches that are serious about working with ethnic peoples in their communities. An initial step that SIM takes in beginning involvement in a city is to do ethnographic studies. MF: What contribution do you feel the U.S. Center will be able to make to the MA2000 campaign? Dave: For one, it is very obvious that a very significant network has been developing through the many Perspectives classes that have been held in dozens of cities throughout the U.S. for the past twenty years. Currently there are over 25,000 alumni, 600+ trained coordinators as well as 600+ professors. Obviously many of these folks are greatly envisioned for the frontiers and are currently serving the cause in various capacities, whether as senders, goers, welcomers or mobilizers. It could very well be that many of the city-wide networkers will emerge from the Perspectives network. Another very promising prospect is the fact that the USCWM is on the brink of releasing two key mobilization tools that are designed to progressively penetrate adult fellowships and study groups with frontier vision as well as help them to daily walk out their World Christian discipleship. MF: What could MF readers expect from the MMRN and MA2000, and how could they help advance the campaign? Dave: I believe MA2000 has great promise for becoming a widely recognized movement due to the numerous other movements that are getting on board (Promise Keepers, Campus Crusade&#39;s Jesus Video project, Concerts of Prayer, Prayer Summits, etc.). Also, the fact that there will be much evangelism and prayer for the lost will very likely open the hearts of many believers to also get involved in world evangelization as opportunities and direction are provided. Mission Frontiers readers can pray for their own cities to get involved as well as to pray for key mission mobilization networkers to be raised up. Without this kind of prayer there is strong likelihood that nothing significant will transpire.

    "title": "United Prayer Track: Tooling for Global Impact",
    "content": "United Prayer Track: Tooling for Global Impact Jack L. Dennison The United Prayer Track was formed in 1990 under the leadership of Dr. Peter Wagner. Incredible advances by the kingdom of God have occurred in the last several years through united prayer. As we look toward the “Mid-decade” progress report at GCOWE ’95, we offer this report regarding our progress and future steps. The United Prayer Track is committed to uniting the praying peoples of the world for the purpose of global evangelization. This linkage occurs in a number of ways. First, by communicating with international and regional networks and representatives who work with literally tens of thousands of prayer cells and millions of individuals worldwide. It is vital to understand what God is doing and saying to praying people around the world. As one prayer warrior recently said, “If you want to know what is on the mind and heart of God, listen to the prayers of His people.” This information is then reported to the church worldwide. Secondly, by assisting those networks and representatives in strategic planning and coordination. You can imagine the administrative task some international networks face when attempting to develop and coordinate the activities of thousands of cells in as many as 50 countries of the world. Some groups require help in developing an administrative infrastructure to support such an effort. Third, the United Prayer Track headquarters in Pasadena, California, provides a clearing house and communication hub regarding strategic prayer initiatives worldwide. Fourth, major catalytic events are occurring almost around the clock worldwide. Some occur in the U.S., while many others are planned in every conceivable spot of the globe. These catalytic events are rallying points for the Church of Christ worldwide, enabling it to united at a particular point in prayer toward a common goal, and, as well, a tooling time of instruction and on-the-job training for countless millions. The Praying Through the Window prayer event of October, 1993, would be one such example, and, of course, A Day To Change the World is another. At least one global event of this magnitude will be conducted annually through the year AD 2000. Lastly, for the first time ever, there is a catalog containing the prayer and spiritual warfare tools available in the U.S. and abroad. The Arsenal was first published in April, 1994, by Dr. Peter Wagner and his staff of Global Harvest Ministries. The Arsenal is a must for any praying Christian, since it contains the most comprehensive listing of prayer and spiritual warfare resources available in the world. The world is currently experiencing a Divine initiative of unusual magnitude. God is calling His people to Himself through prayer. Groups and individuals all over the globe report an unusual prompting to pray as never before. Through modern communications technology, it is possible to track this Divine movement of God through the peoples of the world as He is evangelistically bringing in the harvest of new converts. This evangelistic initiative is clearly of such enormity as to report staggering numbers of daily conversions worldwide. This twofold message of prayer and evangelism is clearly God’s message and method for the Church of the 21st Century. We are witnessing what the Bible has repeatedly declared, that we must first fight and win our battles in the heavenliest before we can seize the spoils on the earth. Prayer is the global force behind the global effect of harvest gathering. God has ushered the church into a new period of divine initiative. This is a day like none other, a day without parallel and precedent. Dr. C. Peter Wagner has assembled the greatest coalition of prayer groups in the history of the Church. In 1989, after returning from the Lusuanne II Conference on World Evangelization, Dr.. Wagner felt a clear call from God to begin to play a more focused role in the study, teaching, and leadership of spiritual warriors. He was surprised by the central role that spiritual warfare played in the workshops and plenary sessions of Lusuanne II. Upon returning to the U.S., he called a meeting of the top scholars and practitioners of spiritual warfare in the country to see what the Spirit of God was saying to each of them regarding prayer and spiritual warfare. soon thereafter, Dr. Luis Bush invited Dr. Wagner to coordinate the United Prayer Track of the AD 2000 Movement, of which the Spiritual Warfare Network is an integral part. What is occurring in the global prayer movement and the involvement of the United Prayer Track as we move toward GCOWE ‘95? Global Prayer Initiatives A Day To Change the World–June 25, 1994: 160 million Christians (one-third of the Christian Church worldwide) are expected to participate in the greatest prayer event in history. Marches for Jesus are expected in 150 of the 252 nations of the world, representing every time zone of the globe, and involving 50 million marchers joyously proclaiming the Lordship of Christ over the neighborhood, city, state, and country. Five hundred cities of North America are expected to participate. More than 5,000 Concerts of Prayer are expected worldwide. Many of these concerts of prayer will occur as the final day’s event, following marches, walks, and other prayer events. More than 50 million Christians representing more than 50 nations of the world will participate in prayer every day of June, and they will fast one day per week during that month as they seek God for global evangelization. One million children are mobilizing for intercession. (See article by Ester Ilnisky) Christians around the world will be gathering at the cardinal points of their continent, country, state, and/or city to proclaim the Lordship of Christ over that geographic area. Many groups will start at the cardinal points of the country or state and move inward toward the center of the area, proclaiming the Lordship of Christ as they go. Praying Through the Window II– October, 1995, will witness the deployment of 10,000 intercessors (400 twenty-five person teams) on prayer expeditions to the 100 least evangelized cities of the world, all of which are located within the 10/40 Window. Additionally, each of the 100 least evangelized cities will be “twinned,” that is, linked to at least one U.S. city and other cities around the world. This will provide additional prayer support and perhaps even a longer-term commitment on the part of these cities to those within the 10/40 Window. October, 1997–will concentrate prayer on the evangelization of 1000 geographic areas which contain “Million People Target Areas” (MPTA). U.S. Prayer Initiatives Identification Repentance - not only is there a great deal of anger between the peoples of the world, but also between the various peoples which comprise the Church. Satan has used this anger to destroy the possibility of unity within the Body, unity that is essential to prayerful and evangelistic effectiveness. Here in the U.S., Peter Wagner has stated that American’s broadest sin is against the African-Americans through our long standing racial prejudice stemming back to our mistreatment and enslavement of this people in our colonial times and continuing to this day. American’s deepest sin is against the Native-American Indian people through our mistreatment, enslavement, annihilation, and treaty-breaking over the course of the last 150 years. Through Divine action, God seems to be calling His people to repentance for and identification with the sins of their forefathers. This spiritual action of genuine repentance, confession, and reconciliation is removing the walls of separation and restoring the oneness of the Church in a powerful way. This experience is more frequently becoming a spontaneous part of both large and small prayer gatherings around the world. God is bringing down the walls between the Japanese and Koreans, the Germans and Europeans, African and African Americans, American Anglos and African-Americans, and Native-American Indians, South-Africans and Africans, and many other ethnic groups. In the U.S., Cindy Jacobs of Generals of Intercession, Jean Steffenson of the Reconciliation Coalition, and John Dawson of Youth With A Mission are leading the way in trumpeting God’s call to reconciliation and providing the training and resourcing needed to do it. City Wide Prayer Alerts - at least 1,000 cities will have ongoing inter-denominational City Prayer Alerts functioning in which local church prayer groups will be praying during a particular hour each week around the clock (168 groups in each city) for spiritual renewal and global evangelization. National Directory of Prayer Groups - this first-ever publication will list and describe all denominational and independent prayer groups in the U.S. and update the informational on a regular basis. First Friday Prayer - the National Prayer Committee has declared the first Friday of every month a special national day to seek God through prayer. Pastors’ Prayer Summits - in more than 100 cities of the U.S., pastors gather annually in large groups and weekly in small groups for ongoing prayer. The four day event has no agenda, no speakers, no study. The time is set aside to be orchestrated by the Spirit of God as He leads the pastors into worship, Scripture reading, prayer, and personal confession and reconciliation. Pastors having once experienced a Prayer summit are unalterably changed and are better prepared and equipped to lead their congregation into a renewed emphasis upon prayer through solemn assemblies, prayer retreats, regular early morning prayer gatherings, and more. Prayer has returned as the bedrock of ministry for a growing number of pastors and churches. Other Divisions The Spiritual Warfare Network Coordinated by Peter Wagner, Global Harvest Ministries. Though not organized as an actual division of the Prayer Track, the Spiritual Warfare Network is nonetheless an integral part. Begun in 1990, the Spiritual Warfare Network (SWN) seeks God’s wisdom and direction as to the ways in which strategic-level intercession might be used by the Holy Spirit in measurably advancing the cause of world evangelization. The network members seek one another for wisdom, encouragement, correction, intercession, partnership in ministry, and cross-fertilization of ideas. This spiritual camaraderie of the group provides balance, accountability, and protection in this fledgling field and movement. In February, 1994, the network sponsored the National Conference on Prayer and Spiritual Warfare in which more than one thousand people participated. Spiritual Mapping Division Coordinated by George Otis, Jr., the Sentinel Group. Spiritual Mapping is one of the newest strategies and resources added to the arsenal for serious intercession. George Otis describes spiritual mapping as “superimposing our understanding of forces and events in the spiritual domain onto places and circumstances in the material world.” The result of this effort is to be able to identify the spiritual forces behind many of the social systems and problems that hold people in bondage, as well as the spiritual forces currently at work within a specific geographic area. This provides strategic information for more concentrated and focused prayerful intercession regarding the activity of spiritual forces. The Spiritual Mapping Division conducts research on the countries of the 10/40 Window and is presently engaged in a research of the sixty major cities within the Window to provide strategic intelligence for millions of prayer warriors. In North America, this division has regionalized into nine geographic areas in order to support and train the individuals involved in emerging local spiritual mapping initiatives. Strategic Prayer Evangelism Division Coordinated by Edgardo Silvoso, Harvest Evangelism. Edgardo Silvoso is a recognized pioneer in the development of what is now being termed “prayer evangelism.” After much success in the cities of Argentina, as well as other places, Silvoso is demonstrating that lost people can be won to Christ primarily through prayer. At the same time, in Silvoso’s design, traditional evangelism methods are also brought in with particular effectiveness when they are focused on a saturation church planting within the city. Not only has Silvoso designed what many missiologists consider the state-of-the-art evangelistic strategy for taking a city, but since it is based primarily on prayer, he has consented to join his activities with the United Prayer Track and organize this new division. One of his initial goals is to have this evangelistic strategy and process implemented in fifty cities by late 1995, and at that time convene a major International Prayer Evangelism Conference in Los Angeles, California. All this represents only a portion of what God is doing worldwide. A fast-paced movement with such scope and magnitude is impossible to keep up with. God has ushered the church into a new period of divine initiative. This is a day like none other, a day without parallel and precedent. God is calling His people back to Himself through prayer and then sending them out to gather in the greatest harvest in history. We may well be witnessing the first fruits of the final harvest of history. In many parts of the world, the harvest is so great-the people are so ready to respond to Christ-as to literally exceed our capability to gather it. We must continue to mobilize prayers who will intercede with the Lord of the harvest to send forth laborers into His fields to gather the harvest before it goes to seed and we lose our opportunity. Dr. Jack L. Dennison is Professor of Pastoral studies, Multnomah Biblical Seminary, Portland, Oregon. He is the Global Communications Coordinator for the United Prayer Track.

    "title": "Get Ready - The Arab World is About to Experience a Spiritual Breakthrough",
    "content": "Get Ready—The Arab World is About to Experience a Spiritual Breakthrough Luis Bush Introduction A question that world Christians should ask themselves is: “Is the statement that the Arab World is unreachable true?” After reading this article my hope is that you will say, along with an increasing number of Arab nationals and internationals who have worked there for years, a resounding “No.&quot; As a veteran leading international says: “Tectonic changes are occurring in the Middle East. The Spirit of God is moving in currents across the Arab World. We are living in pregnant days.” “The Middle East is a very misunderstood part of the world. Stereotypes abound, especially negative stereotypes about Arab people. In an area of contradictions and conflicts— excessive wealth and abject poverty; ancient Christian centers in the midst of Arab countries, the old in conflict with the new; western political ideologies and materialism in conflict with eastern culture; a society where passion is mixed with tolerance.” Abu Wasiim, CSG Report. There are twenty-two Arabic speaking countries spread across North Africa, the Central Middle East and the Arabian Peninsula. Together they have a population of some 230 million people, which is growing at the rate of half a million per month. For centuries the Arab World has been thought of as spiritually impenetrable. But times are changing. Every Arab national and international Christian I spoke to in recent weeks have agreed that a major spiritual breakthrough is coming. As a mature international has said: “Let us gear to the times and anchor to the rock.” There are five reasons given to point to the fact that a spiritual breakthrough is coming in the Arab World. I. ARAB NATIONAL CHRISTIAN INITIATIVES ARE GROWING RAPIDLY It was the sixteenth gathering of Arab evangelical Christian leaders from the Middle East. Arab Christians have been taking the initiative to cultivate fellowship among other Christians in the region, building unity, partnerships and effective missions. As with earlier meetings, the program and agenda were theirs. The leadership and vast majority of the speakers were theirs. The fruit of their efforts was demonstrable in two notable realities: first, this was the largest and most representative; 164 people came from 24 countries of the world. Second, the substance of the content, and spirit of unity was evident to all. A number of veteran Western missionaries who have been tracking the progress from the beginnings expressed awe at the maturing of the leadership, vision and impact. In January 1985, a meeting was held in Belgium for a number of Arab Christian leaders to fellowship, dialogue and pray for the ministries in the Arab world. Their vision and dreams began to have an increasingly clear form as they prayed and had fellowship together. In successive years they met and whenever the group came together, they experienced the powerful presence of the Lord. Their unity in Christ became more tangible when they organized the Arab World Servants Fellowship (AWSF), a lay- guided Evangelical movement of like-minded Christian Arab leaders. The Lord met their needs for closer fellowship, ministry training and relief work. Paramount to all of them, however, was the need for a broader and deeper work of evangelism among Arabic speaking peoples. In March 1992, a meeting was held in Cyprus by AWSF for a number of Evangelical ministers in the Arab world. This included a broader spectrum of Christian denominations. All who attended felt led by God&#39;s grace and the guidance of the Holy Spirit to establish the Arab World Evangelical Ministers Association— AWEMA. (The term “ministers” in Arabic speaks of “those who serve” and includes both lay and vocational ministers. The renewed vision of AWEMA for the Arab world was (1) to enhance deep fellowship among Christian ministers; (2) to coordinate evangelistic thrusts among Arabic speaking people worldwide; and (3) to support a number of ministers among Arabic speaking people throughout the world. In 1995 the plan is to bring together western agencies to cultivate greater partnerships between the Arab world and the rest of the world. The Arab leaders have also taken the initiative with regard to the process of identification, selection and recruitment of the 170 participants from all 21 countries for the GCOWE &#39;95 consultation, along with another 50 international Arabs living outside of the Arab World. Taking into account the recommendations by both national and international leaders from around the world for that region, they carefully reviewed and selected those persons who best fit the criteria established to participate in GCOWE &#39;95, planned for Seoul, Korea in May 1995. A significant amount of the funding for the international travel will be provided by the Arab nationals from within the region. II. PREPARATION OF THE GROUND THROUGH CAREFUL STUDY A Cooperative Strategy Group (CSG) came together in an attempt &quot;to correct distorted images and paint a more comprehensive and coherent picture&quot; of the Middle East, to help inform and enable the Christian public worldwide and to help Arab evangelicals and international mission executives obtain a clearer perspective of the missionary task in the region. It was estimated that the survey covered approximately 90% of the work being done by international mission organizations in the Arab world. It was a day a year ago in a country in the Middle East; I recall the scene of 4200 pages of data lying in piles around the apartment. A young international was pulling together several summary charts that would underscore the realities of Christian work in the Middle East as perhaps never before. I suddenly realized that, there in that small apartment, probably more information was gathered about the ministry in the Middle East than at any other place or time. This massive report was presented in summary form to fifty key leaders who met at a Cooperative Strategy Group consultation to evaluate and refine the findings. The report clearly presents the state of the existing church and mission programs in the Middle East with an analysis of mega-trends in the region and the formulation of a commonly agreed upon set of mission priorities for the Arab world to the year 2000. One quarter of the agencies gave specific and measurable objectives to be reached by the year 2000. The CSG recognized some limitations, such as the lack of data from the Arabian Peninsula and some parts of North Africa, and the fact that the report reflected the perception of the church and mission leaders participating in the survey and in some areas, there may be differences between perception and reality. Regardless of these limitations, the report graphically and clearly highlights the mega-trends, priority tasks emerging out of these trends and long-term planning suggestions. One interesting conclusion of the report was the warning given to both Arab nationals and international missions, in as much as there has been a tendency in the region to focus more on quality than quantity— “to the point where we lose sight of the whole task in front of us.” Another conclusion that was instrumental in calling for the latest consultation on partnership was stated as follows: “Arab nationals felt that their biggest problems were lack of unity in the church...” Thus, this concern and report contributed to a plan to bring unity, cooperation and partnership both among national Christians in the Arab world as well as between Arab nationals and internationals. III. COOPERATION AND PARTNERSHIP ARE INCREASING So much has progressed toward cooperation and partnership since the CSG report. A major consultation brought together national Christians from almost all of the countries of the Arab world in an Arab country. The purpose was to forge bonds of unity and cooperation among national Christians in the region in order to partner together. Full discussion was given to such topics as the realities and obstacles of partnership, the biblical patterns of partnership, the model of partnership, the challenges of partnership, the potential areas of partnership and a plan for partnership. The spirit of unity and strong commitment to work together toward the future was evident to all. As one of the organizers of the gathering concluded afterwards: “This is why I believe we are about to experience a major spiritual breakthrough in the region. There is a new spirit of unity and desire to work together.” For the future, a gathering has already been planned to bring together internationals representing agencies and organizations all over the world who are interested in cooperating together with the emerging national partnerships to take new strides in international partnership. In fact, new international groups with proven credibility in their work in other regions of the world have been encouraged to participate in the next gathering. IV. GLOBAL PRAYER FOCUS ON THE ARAB WORLD GROWS ANNUALLY While significant advance is being made within the region in working together, interest is growing around the world for a spiritual breakthrough to take place in the Arab world. Last year for the October, Praying Through the Window effort more than 1200 local churches from different parts of the world adopted one of the twenty-one Arab countries for special prayer during the month of October. On-site intercessory teams came to each of the countries for days of prayer and fasting, asking God for a spiritual breakthrough to take place. Millions of others worldwide joined in the concerted prayer effort. Beginning in the month of global prayer focus in June 1994, culminating with what has been called &quot;The Day to Change the World,” there will again be special prayer by millions of Christians around the world for the Arab peoples. The prayer pamphlet highlights a different family of peoples for global prayer focus each day of the week. On Monday each week it will be for the Arab peoples. A suggested “gateway people,” “gateway city” and “gateway ministry” have been described for each of these family of peoples in the pamphlet, as specific ways to lift up the Arab peoples through prayer. In 1995, building upon the prayer momentum of 1993 and 1994, there will be a further global prayer focus on the megacities of the 10/40 Window. Each of the megacities of the 21 countries will attract special prayer from Christians throughout the world. Ten thousand on-site intercessors in four hundred teams are expected to enter cities throughout the 10/40 Window. And so, in 1996 and 1997 specific efforts are already planned to continue to focus global prayer on this part of the world. When a well-respected international working in the area commented that he anticipated a spiritual harvest in the Arab world in the near future, I asked him: “Why?” He answered: “Growing awareness and prayers of the saints around the world.” V. EXPECTATION OF ON-SITE NATIONALS AND INTERNATIONAL WORKERS HEIGHTENS “We are in the generation in which the Arab world will dramatically see a spiritual breakthrough.&quot; Clancy Murphy, veteran worker in the Arab world. Why? &quot;For three reasons: First, the Arab world-view has changed, influenced by western materialism, the Gulf War and Islamic Fundamentalism. Second, there is growing awareness and prayers of the saints around the world. Third, my own on the ground experience of the move of God&#39;s spirit drawing people to Himself.” Another long-term international noted: “One of the greatest challenges we face is that the churches already in place may not be ready for the influx of new believers that we are going to see in the near future.” It is being observed that: “God is doing something new. There is a new spirit of unity in our midst.” Another Arab national put it this way: “God is about to do something that we have thought less than even one half of.” CONCLUSION: It is time for God&#39;s people around the world to get ready—undoubtedly, a spiritual breakthrough in the Arab world is coming. Arab national Christian initiatives are growing rapidly. Preparation of the ground has been made through careful study Cooperation and partnership are increasing. Global prayer focus on the Arab world is intensive and increasing. Expectation of on-site nationals and international missionaries heightens. What should the global Christian do? First, let us gear to the times and anchor to the rock. Let us become informed and aware of what God is doing in our time. Second, let us get involved through personal and corporate prayer for the Arab world. Begin praying with your family, at your church, with Christians at school, at work or in your neighborhood right away and don&#39;t stop until the spiritual breakthrough occurs! As Dr. Rev. Ghassan Khalaf, President of the Arab Theological Seminary in Lebanon and Pastor of the Hadith Baptist Church said, “I believe revival is coming soon to the church in the Arab world. I have been a student of church history for many years. Every other region has experienced revival except ours! Now it is our turn.” So be it Lord!!

    "title": "GCOWE '95, Global Consultation on World Evangelization by the Year 2000 & Beyond in Seoul, Korea",
    "content": "GCOWE &#39;95, Global Consultation on World Evangelization by the Year 2000 &amp; Beyond in Seoul, Korea Luis Bush Introduction GCOWE &#39;95 is a mid-decade global strategy meeting on world evangelization to be held in Seoul, Korea, May 17-26, 1995. The theme of GCOWE &#39;95 is: &quot;A church for every people and the gospel for every person by AD2000.&quot; To participate in the event each invitee must sign a declaration form of understanding and responsibility. Only those persons committed to the theme and prepared to implement the goal in their own country will be accepted for GCOWE &#39;95. Furthermore, participants are expected to raise their own international travel funds to attend. Forty five hundred are expected to come from approximately 200 countries of the world. Registrations for GCOWE &#39;95 are already being received in Hyderabad from those invited from India. The purpose of GCOWE &#39;95 is to encourage continued momentum building toward the fulfillment of the goal of a church for every people and the gospel for every person by the year 2000. An underlying assumption of GCOWE &#39;95 is a divine superintending of current global events of such import that we are moving from an age of unbelief to an age of faith as we approach the year 2000. The explosive growth of the Two Thirds World church in this century has positioned the Church around the world for a major evangelistic thrust in the nineties. Many church and mission leaders now believe that genuine collaborative partnerships is the only way to take advantage of the opportunities presented by the last decade of this millennium. Increased momentum building toward world evangelization is anticipated as a result of GCOWE &#39;95. Many groups within the body of Christ, individually and collectively, will set or revise their own year 2000 goals for world evangelization. Paving the road to this global event, more than 100 national, regional, and functional consultations will have been held around the world. A growing number of Christians will work and pray with greater common focus towards the turn of the century. GCOWE &#39;95 is a mid-decade assessment point to bring these groups together. By setting ongoing strategies as Christians work together through separate but cooperative programs, it is hoped that the body of Christ will increase mobilization in every country of the world toward fulfillment of the goal of a church for every people and the gospel for every person by the year 2000. Seven characteristics of GCOWE &#39;95 have begun to shape the nature of the event, and the process leading up to it and its expected results, which are identified in this article: I. Assessment Of The Unfinished Task Four global surveys have been launched to foster the presentation of the &quot;best picture&quot; of the unfinished task as it relates to the goal of a church for every people and the gospel for every person by the year 2000. (See chart below.) Assessment of progress of evangelism is currently been conducted among the peoples, cities, countries, and geographic areas of at least one million people. An evaluation will be made of the progress toward the assessment goal by each country and region, augmented by the contribution of each associated Resource Network and Task Force towards the goal. An identification of the major obstacles to fulfilling these purposes in each country, region and Resource Network will be sought. II. Prayer For World Evangelization Prayer will be offered up for a reconciliation of God&#39;s people between countries, races and ethnic people on behalf of a fractured world, and between Christian leaders within Christian organizations, denominations, global movements, countries, and regions of the world. One hundred and twenty on-site international intercessors will be praying around the clock during GCOWE &#39;95. Fifty children between 8 and 12 years old, selected because of their unusually mature prayer life, will be engaged on-site in prayer and intercession in an expected fulfillment of Psalm 8:2 &quot;From the lips of children and infants you have ordained praise…to silence the foe and the avenger.&quot; A key focus of prayer will be revitalization of church leaders through the sharing of principles and models of effective local church mobilization, church renewal and world evangelization taking place at GCOWE &#39;95. As a result of GCOWE &#39;95 there will be great potential for increased mobilization of united prayer efforts by linking such networks nationally, regionally and collectively around the globe to focus prayer on world evangelization. (See the chart on this page.) Significant emphasis will be placed on the next major global prayer initiative, Praying Through the Window III: Targeting 100 Major Megacities. Profiles of these 100 least evangelized megacities will be distributed for focused intercessory prayer in support of 10,000 on-site intercessors comprising 400 teams and for the general welfare of these cities. During GCOWE &#39;95, fervent prayer will be focused on overcoming the obstacles by country, region, and Resource Network. There will be prayer through identified factors concentrating upon the question of whether the goals specified are attainable in each country, region and Resource Network. III. Grass Roots Involvement In Every Aspect Of The Process Selection Following a three year process of recommendations for the various networks and countries, more than 27,000 names of Christian leaders have been received from around the world in the International Office. Through an extended, sometimes painful, process of assessment involving several reviews by national, regional and Resource Network leaders, invitees have been selected who best meet a strict list of criteria developed during this process. Registration The registration of GCOWE &#39;95 is being conducted, for the most part, at the national level rather than from the International Office. In each country a registrar has been identified to conduct the registration process in their country. The registrar is also the national coordinator in the country. The registrar is encouraged to convene the invitees, review and complete the registration process and later discuss the best method of preparing logistically and to significantly contribute to GCOWE &#39;95 meeting objectives. Fees for the registration remains in the office overseeing the registration. Funding Each participant is being strongly encouraged to raise his/her own international travel support. In some cases, delegates in the more financially developed countries are being asked to contribute to subsidies for participants invited from countries where economic conditions do not allow a participant to raise all his/her own travel. In some instances, countries in a position to do so have adopted other country delegations to subsidize their international travel. The hosting of Korea has offered to cover the costs of food, housing and local transportation in Korea for many of the two-thirds world participants expected. Program The program is designed to provide strong affinity group bonding, networking opportunities, and ownership of goals and objectives by Resource Network and/or other organizational groupings. In addition, the program will provide strong country-wide group exposure meetings, and related bonding and networking opportunities in moving toward cultivating an environment of encouragement for setting country-wide initiatives to AD2000. Moreover, it will be designed to establish distinct follow-up plans outlining specific action items and dates, by track and by country for each significant emphasis. Thus, the primary program focus is not inspirational, but rather an in-process review/assessment meeting, looking at the status of the &quot;unfinished task&quot; in reference to efforts initiated earlier and projected toward completion. The program will comprise three primary parts; country emphasis, by Resource Networks (tracks) emphasis and in combination. IV. Mobilizers And Practitioners Networking Together Those invited to GCOWE &#39;95 are expected to be the &quot;shakers and movers&quot; in national and world evangelization efforts. (See the charts on this Page.) The criteria by which people were recommended is as follows: Credibility--an active member of a local church, recognized by the national leaders and respected by the different segments of the church as being in good standing in his/her immediate Christian community. Experience--A responsible Christian leader who is recognized in the interest area of the Resource Network. Bridge builder--Prepared to build bridges between God&#39;s people within the country and internationally. Spiritual maturity--Above reproach in his/her testimony; approved by church leadership in the country and possessing his/her own accountability support structure. A person of Vision--Burdened for the church in his/her country and for the evangelization of the country. A person who truly desires to see a church for every people and the gospel for person in his/her country and in the world. A team player--Works well with others and can comfortably interact with those who might disagree with him/her while maintaining mutual respect. A Leader with organizational support--Has the support and organizational structure to develop resource networks within the country. A person of faith--Prepared to trust God for finances to travel nationally and internationally. Ability to communicate in one of the UNITED NATIONS languages. English will be the primary language used at GCOWE &#39;95 with translation into seven major languages. Every participant will have a pre-assigned Track in which they will function during that portion of GCOWE &#39;95. Five hundred carefully selected individuals have been sought for the Mobilization of New Missionaries Resource Network. They are expected to mobilize 10,000 missions mobilizers who in turn will mobilize 200,000 new missionaries among the unreached by the year 2000. Five hundred well-screened geographic area coordinators are being sought for coordinated saturation evangelism efforts in each of the geographic target areas of one million people throughout the world via God&#39;s Word and Literature, the Jesus film, as well as personal and mass evangelism initiatives. Two hundred and fifty national research mobilizers engaged in the establishment of permanent missiological research functions in their own countries are being invited. Five hundred and fifty pastors committed to mobilize their laity for national evangelization and world missions--through initiatives such as the June March for Jesus, the June 25th Day to Change the World prayer initiative, and other significant outreach programs--are expected to participate in GCOWE &#39;95. Three hundred national supervisors of major global and independent denominations, who influence entire denominations in their countries are expected to participate in GCOWE &#39;95. Three hundred people involved in establishing networks and partnerships and who possess creative models to reach the unreached peoples are among those coming. Three hundred people engaged in city-wide holistic ministry, evangelism and church planting--especially among the urban poor--have been recruited. Over five hundred leaders representing major prayer networks are expected to participate. More than one hundred people committed to and engaged in presenting the gospel to everyone via radio by the year 2000 have been identified, selected and recruited for GCOWE &#39;95. Five hundred women representing women active in prayer and evangelism initiatives that are making a difference in their nations have been carefully selected. Three hundred key leaders engaged in the translation, production, distribution and nurture through God&#39;s Word and Literature have been invited to participate. Over three hundred &quot;John Knox&quot; type Christian leaders who are involved in saturation church planting efforts in their countries are scheduled to participate at GCOWE &#39;95. V. National Strategy Development With the input of national models, participants representing various tracks and denominational initiatives delegates will meet by country to assess the unfinished task, to set goals, to identify factors influencing the success of their purpose, and to formulate follow-up plans. As a result, it is expected that current national strategy initiatives will be strengthened and many fresh initiatives will be launched. (See the chart below) Zaire is one of the models of a national strategy to be presented at GCOWE &#39;95. The main objective of the movement &quot;All for Christ AD2000&quot; in Zaire is to double the number of believers in every urban and rural congregation there by the year 2000. Following a national consultation in January 1993, a committee of 130 members in 16 groups was formed. Support for the vision came from the evangelism and missions departments of 63 denominations. Thirty thousand copies of materials were printed in six languages in order to equip every pastor. Each one has been given a copy of the working document to use in 1994. In assessing the degree of mobilization of each of the ten AD2000 Tracks on a scale from 0 to 5, only three scored a 3 or 4. All others scored a 5 which means: &quot;completely mobilized.&quot; VI. Major Korean Role &quot;We are looking forward to seeing historical, unprecedented, monumental, supernatural and global revival to fulfill the Great Commission taking place in this generation. . . the Korean church has the potential, willingness and sense of urgency. . .Koreans want to be unified. . . the AD2000 Movement will be beneficial not only for Korean evangelization, but also for world evangelization.&quot; These words by Korean GCOWE &#39;95 Preparation Committee Chairman Joon Gon Kim, reflect the kind of expectation to be found in the Korean church in relation to the AD2000 &amp; Beyond Movement and GCOWE &#39;95. While hosting GCOWE &#39;95, the Koreans will be holding two parallel strategic conferences. The first is a conference for 10,000 Korean pastors and the second a conference for 500 Korean missionaries being flown in from around the world to participate. Korea: Modeling a National AD2000 initiative Five large scrap books, each containing forty pages filled with news articles of the different activities related to the AD2000 Movement in Korea, are a testimony to the spread of the vision within Korea. Four monthly, eight-page AD2000 news letters have been printed in Korean and circulated among 5,000 carefully selected Christian leaders throughout the country to inform them about activities and news items on a national and global level. The goal of the Preparation Committee is to share the AD2000 vision with Christian leaders in the 250 largest cities and towns and organize AD2000 committees in all of them. In each of these cities and towns Christian leaders from different denominations are encouraged to establish a city-wide AD2000 committee to take the basic elements of the national plan and adapt it to their own city. Hosting The beautiful Korean Center for World Missions will be the venue for GCOWE &#39;95. Already they have 35 full- and part-time staff on the fifth floor of the Korean Center for World Mission. All major denominations and local churches have expressed their support for the AD2000 Movement in Korea. One of the indications of this is that the Korea AD2000 Committee has agreed to raise the expenses for food, housing and transportation within Korea for approximately 3,000 delegates from the two-thirds world. Praying The Korean Preparation Committee is organizing massive prayer support for GCOWE &#39;95 participants. They have requested that each selected GCOWE &#39;95 participant selected supply a brief profile of their ministry accompanied by a photo so each one can be given to a different local church in Korea for prayer. This way some 4500 local churches in Korea are being encouraged to participate. The Korean church plans to gather over one million Christians for the Day to Change the World on June 25, 1994. One of the main emphases will be for the unification of North and South Korea. They do not expect to be caught unprepared for the time when North Korea opens. One million Christians are being challenged by them to adopt and pray for a district in North Korea. Their vision is that 100,000 students will form teams and take a year-long break from their collegiate studies to live in the districts for which they have prayed. While there, they will serve in the communities, evangelize and work towards their goal of planting more than 30,000 churches. To date, more than 50,000 students have already made such a commitment. VII. Climactic Consecration On the last evening of GCOWE &#39;95, the current plan, pending confirmation, is to hold the meeting in a stadium with GCOWE &#39;95 participants, the 10,000 Korean pastors, the 500 Korean missionaries from around the world, friends and supporters of the AD2000 &amp; Beyond Movement and other key Korean and world leaders present in Seoul at that time. It is planned to be a night of consecration by each country delegation for the goals of evangelization that they have outlined for their individual countries and the world to the year 2000. In the stands there would be a great host of mainly Korean witnesses who would join in prayer for them and their goals. An all night prayer meeting would be held. This would be the climax of GCOWE &#39;95: &quot;…an unforgettable night of consecration of each individual and country to the goal of a church for every people and the gospel for every person in their country and the world by the year 2000.&quot; Conclusion We pray GCOWE &#39;95 will result in continued and significant momentum building toward the fulfillment of the goal of a church for every people and the gospel for every person by the year 2000. The last five years of the decade, century and millenium will likely be the years of the greatest mobilization of the body of Christ working in concert to reap the greatest spiritual harvest of all time. My prayer is that you will want to be a part of the spirit, the vision and the action of this global spiritual initiative.

    "title": "Muslims Being Reached Foremostly Through Extraordinary Prayer",
    "content": "Muslims Being Reached Foremostly Through Extraordinary Prayer J. Christy Wilson, Jr Undergirding the Effort with Prayer “The opening of the Muslim world for the gospel,” writes Patrick Johnstone, “cannot be organized by human effort or stratagems but only by prayer. Our weapons are spiritual, not carnal. Pray for an army of intercessors to be raised up that a breakthrough as decisive and sudden as that in China and the former USSR may also occur in theMuslim world.”1 Of the approximately 11,000 people groups in the world still to be evangelized, about 4,000 of them are Islamic. OurLord has promised, “This gospel of the kingdom will be preached in all the world as a testimony to all nations(ethne or people groups), and then the end will come.”2 In that same passage,Christ said, “Heaven and earth will pass away, but My words will never pass away.”3 Thus world evangelization is absolutely certain. But how are theMuslim people groups going to be reached? The answer is: Foremostly through extraordinary prayer. The First Level Dr. J. Edwin Orr, in his books on the history of awakenings, has pointed out that there are four levels to every true revival.4 This is true in the book of Acts and on down through Church history. (1) The first stage is prayer and reconciliation among Christians. (2) The second is evangelism as the lost are won to theLord. (3) The third is that of missions with participation in world evangelization and, (4) the fourth is our service for Christ in action as we love our neighbors as ourselves and supply their needs physically, intellectually, socially and spiritually. Most of the revivals in the past have been localized because of the difficulty of transportation and communication. I believe that we are now on the verge of an awakening of worldwide proportions. This will fulfill the prophecy of Joel,5 quoted by the apostle Peter: In the last days, God says, I will pour out My Spirit on all people. Your sons and your daughters will prophesy, your young men will see visions, your old men will dream dreams. Even on my servants, both men and women, I will pour out My Spirit in those days, and they will prophesy, I will show wonders in the heaven above, and signs in the earth below. And everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.6 This revival, I believe, will bring about the completion of Christ’s com-mission of world-wide evangelization and will be the heart of reaching un-reached Muslim groups for Christ. Revival Resulting in Missions to Muslims We see this on a limited scale in the awakening of 1858 and following. It started with a convert of Charles Finney who was an urban missionary, by the name of Jeremiah Lanphier, who began the Fulton Street Wednesday noon prayer meeting in 1857 for workers and business people in New York City. Within six months, about ten thousand were gathering for prayer every noon. This revival resulted in over a million converts being added to the American churches in the next two years. The most prominent leader of this awakening in the States, as well as in the British Isles, was D. L. Moody. One of his closest associates, Ruben A. Torrey, said that Moody was a far greater man of prayer than he was a preacher. Here again we see the absolute necessity of intercession in great awakenings. Moody was not only involved in evangelism, as huge numbers came to Christ through his messages, but he also helped establish the Y.M.C.A. in North America, started schools for girls and boys, established the Moody Bible Institute and founded a Christian publishing house, now called Moody Press. His involvement in missions, which is another stage of true revival, came through close friends like Arthur T. Pier-son who popularized the phrase, “The evangelization of the world in this generation.” In reference to this, Moody said, “It can be done—it ought to be done—it must be done.”7 According to our Lord’s promise in Matt. 24:14, we can add “It will be done.” In the sum-mer of 1886, Moody invited Pierson along with Adoniram Judson Gordon to speak to 251 student leaders who had been invited to his Mount Hermon School for Boys in Massachusetts. One of these was Robert Wilder who had just completed his senior year at Princeton. Wilder was born in India where his parents had been missionaries. He and his sister, Grace, prayed faithfully that 100 of the students at the Mount Hermon Conference would give their lives for foreign missionary service. In answer to their intercession, exactly 100signed the pledge, “God helping me, I purpose to be a foreign missionary,”and the Student Volunteer Movement was born. The following academic year of 1886-87, Robert Wilder and John Foreman, a seminary student, spread the vision by visiting campuses across the United States and Canada. Over 2,000 more signed the pledge to become missionaries. One of them was Samuel Zwemer at Hope College in Holland, Michigan. He went on to become the greatest missionary to Muslim peoples in history. Download PDF for full article. Download PDF: Muslims-Being-Reached-Foremostly-Through-Extraordinary-Prayer.pdf",

    "title": "Praying Through the 10/40 Window - Update",
    "content": "Praying Through the 10/40 Window - Update Mission Frontiers AD2000 News and Updates During the month of October, all around the world, Christians joined together in &quot;Praying Through the Window,&quot; probably the most widespread prayer effort in the history of the Church. Like never before, over 20 million Christians are focused on an area called the 10/40 Window. This window stretches across North Africa, through the Middle East and India, on through China, from 10 degrees north of the equator to 40 degrees north. Begun less than 18 months ago, Praying Through the Window has spread like wildfire around the world. Ben Gray, pastor of Gateway Center in Brisbane, Australia says, &quot;The nation has never seen anything like it. It is an unprecedented wave, pulling in an incredible cross section of the church, all uniting to pray through the window. Virtually everyone who hears about it wants to do it, and at least 25% of all churches have heard about it. And the wave is still cresting.&quot; The United States Well over one million North Americans are also part of Praying Through the Window. From small Bible studies to mega-churches, nationwide prayer networks, national conferences, Christian radio and TV and dozens of publications, they are all involved in praying or helping to spread the word. Charisma magazine, with a circulation of 200,000, focused much of the October issue on Praying Through the Window. The Back to the Bible Broadcast airs on 765 stations around the world in 17 languages. The organization promotes Praying Through the Window through these radio programs and in Today, its magazine which has 100,000 subscribers. John Kyle, Executive Director of the Presbyterian Church in America&#39;s Mission to the World, has just reported that 100,000 of his denomination are involved in Praying Through the Window. In fact, the response to Praying Through the Window has been so successful that organizers are taking about another 10/40 Window prayer initiative in June 1994. A significant part of the &quot;Praying Through then Window&quot; initiative is the 249 &quot;Prayer Journey Teams,&quot; comprised primarily of trained lay people. These teams are fanning out to all of the 62 countries of the 10/40 Window. During October, the teams &quot;prayed on site with insight&quot; asking God to remove whatever barriers might keep the people of that country from being able to clearly hear and respond to the gospel. C. Peter Wagner believes that despite the obstacles, the prayer teams, &quot;empowered by God,... can pave the way for an outpouring of the Spirit in lands previously enslaved to &quot;spiritual darkness.&quot; Christians focusing their united prayers on the countries of the 10/40 window is the simple theme of Praying Through the Window. But one of this initiative&#39;s great strengths is how people have adapted it to their local context. The Pacific The Solomon Islands are often called the South Korea of the South Pacific because of their deep commitment to prayer. And after 20 years of revival it seems an apt title. Therefore it is not surprising that the Praying Through the Window inititive has caught on there as well. Out of a total population of 800,000 people in Fiji, 100,000 &quot;prayed through the window&quot; during October. Asia Malasia--During a September visit to Malaysia, C. Peter Wagner said he believes that Malaysia has one of the world&#39;s leading prayer mobilization movements. The Malaysians were also committed to the October initiative. Japan--Luis Bush gives a coupleof examples, &quot;In Osaka, Japanese believers, have leased a 60,000 seat stadium for three nights of prayer rallies. Paul Ariga mobililized 9,000 intercessors to pray for this event for 180,000 hours. In Nepal, they are planning a prayer march through the capital. China--David Wang, International Director of Asian Outreach, a cutting-edge ministry in 20 Asian nations, is airing shortwave radio broadcasts to the hundreds of thousands of house churches in China, focusing on praying through the 10/40 Window. Based upon his informed understanding of the house church situation in China and their dependence on these broadcasts for teaching and input, Wang believes that as many as 15 million Chinese and maybe more prayed with him through the Window during the month of October. Cambodia--A letter from Cambodia, tells of their plans to gather at the Killing Fields museum to &quot;acknowledge the goodness of God for carrying us through such a national atrocity... and to remind ourselves that those million people who died on the &quot;killing fields,&quot; went to the next world without Christ. This compassion will lead us to double our efforts to reach the rest of our countrymen by the year 2000.&quot; Latin America Throughout Central America, the coverage about the 10/40 prayer initiative has been extensive, with concentrated efforts in virtually all of the Central American countries. In Brazi, Paulo Mendez, the General Secretary of the Association of Mission Agencies, pulled together over 1000 leaders from all over the country. During October, at least one million Brazilians &quot;prayed through the window.&quot; In Columbia--Desafio, the leading newspaper for evangelicals devoted a whole issue to Praying Through the Window. In Argentina-- Marfa Cabrera, the co-pastor of the 80,000 member Vision of the Future Church, has a radio program which is broadcast over 550 radio stations. She has used her program and a video to train and encourage her listeners to pray through the 10/40 Window. Many nations are reporting how this movement is bringing together charismatics, evangelicals and people from mainline denominations. &quot;You just can&#39;t trust people to stay in their little boxes anymore,&quot; chuckles Ted Haggard, pastor of the 4,500 -strong New Life Church in Colorado Springs and head of the Christian Information Network, which is handling the logistics of Praying Through the Window. Clearly, Praying Through the Window, is something God has laid upon the heart of many in His Church around the world. The Church is responding in prayer and now waits and watches with expectation for how the hand of God will move to touch those within the 10/40 Window. AD2000 Leaders Agree on Future Prayer Initiatives Luis Bush, International Director of the AD2000 and Beyond Movement, along with Dr. C. Peter Wagner of the AD2000 United Prayer Track, have set some goals for the future. Desiring to build on the tremendous momentum of the Praying Through the Window initiative they have determined that in October 1995 the efforts of the AD2000 United Prayer Track will focus on praying for the 100 largest cities in the 10/40 Window. In October of 1996 the prayer focus will be on the 200 largest unreached peoples or megapeoples in the 10/40 Window. The following year in 1997 the focus will be on praying for the 1,000 clusters of Million People Target Areas (MPTAs) as initiated by Campus Crusade for Christ in their New Life 2000 project. A phrase in a letter from Luis Bush to Peter Wagner sums up the reason behind these new initiatives. &quot;I believe the Church around the world is ready to take the next step.&quot; An Evangelized India by AD2000 There are about one million villages and colonies in India, only 10 percent of which have a Christian witness. According to a preliminary survey by the Adopt-A-People Clearinghouse, the Summer Institute of Linguistics and World Vision/MARC, India has 1,727 unreached and adoptable peoples. In addition, India has 223 cities with a population over 100,000, and nine of these have more than one million people. Leaders of denominations, churches, mission and agencies are increasingly recognizing the need to work together to finish the colossal task of evangelizing India. For example, the Council on National Service (CONS) sponsored the All India Congress on Church Development in 1990, a gathering of 1,200 frontline evangelists, missionaries and church leaders. Trusting in the power of the Holy Spirit, the attendees committed to a goal of reaching all of India with the gospel, focusing on developing the vision of reaching the entire nation, gathering data on the unreached peoples and developing training programs to prepare the grass-root level leaders for evangelism and church planting. As a part of this vision, the India National Evangelical Fellowship has a goal of planting 1000 churches by AD2000, and Bible-Centered Ministries (India) has already planted 249 churches of these. India Every Home Crusade has launched &quot;Final Thrust 5000&quot; under the leadership of B.A.G. Prasad. Its leaders plan to connect new believers with any Bible-believing churches in their area, for nurture and fellowship. In addition, they aim to plant 250,000 churches or &quot;Christ Groups&quot; in the villages and towns where there are no churches. The &quot;5,000&quot; in the project title refers to the number of laborers who will be placed in the 4000 districts in India. To equip workers for reaching these goals, portable training programs are training leaders of churches and mission agencies engaged in evangelism, missionary outreach, and church planting. The AD2000 and Beyond Movement is assisting these varied ministries in working together to accomplish their goals.

    "title": "The AD2000 Women’s Track",
    "content": "The AD2000 Women’s Track Lorry Lutz Dreaming and making plans for the year 2000 Christian women in Abidjan, Ivory Coast have caught the vision to reach unreached peoples. Violet Mtegha, the regional representative for the AD2000 Women&#39;s Track, tells of one woman who selected the Tuareg people, thinking that &quot;all&quot; she would have to do is pray. Then she discovered a group of Tuaregs living in Abidja, and realized that God had even more for her to do. The AD2000 Women&#39;s Track is a resource network of women leaders committed to mobilize and help women use their gifts to further the goals of &quot;A Church for every people and the Gospel for every person by the year 2000.&quot; The Women&#39;s Track seeks to catalyze existing networks, bringing denominational and para-church women leaders together, to enhance their prayer groups and to find ways to help women use their gifts in reaching those without Christ. Fifteen regional representatives gathered in Colorado Springs in October to evaluate the progress of the Track and to dream and strategize about what women can do to hasten world evangelism by the year 2000. Since these leaders first met two and half years ago, they have been actively spreading the AD2000 vision. They have held eight regional consultations and distributed a quarterly newsletter to women in more than 120 countries. &quot;Our women knew there was something more,&quot; reiterated Evelyn Christenson, Co-chairperson of the North American Women&#39;s Track and author of the best-selling book What Happens When Women Pray? That &quot;something more&quot; is a new vision and urgency to see Christ&#39;s love communicated among every people group on earth. The women who attended the consultation represent a broad spectrum of gifted leadership roles. Judy Mbugua of Kenya, who is also the chairperson of the Women&#39;s Track, is the international coordinator of the Pan African Christian Women&#39;s Association (ACWA), a branch of the Association of Evangelicals in Africa and Madagascar. Since 1989 African women have formed chapters in almost 30 countries. AD2000 has become the evangelism/prayer arm of this interdenominational ministry, which also deals with social and economic issues women face in Africa. Dr. Inonge Lewanika, member of the Zambian parliament, heads the opposition party in her country. She returned from the consultation to intensive campaigning. If her party wins, she would become the first woman president of an African nation. &quot;But,&quot; says Dr. Lewanika, &quot;my heart is first and foremost that of an evangelist and I&#39;m determined to use my political role to open doors for the gospel.&quot; The Study Guide for Evangelism Praying, written for the AD2000 Women&#39;s Track by Evelyn Christenson, has been distributed in 84 countries and translated into eight languages. Juliet Thomas, leader of Women&#39;s Ministries of Operation Mobilization in India has organized women in 30 cities into triplet prayer groups, using the &quot;Study Guide.&quot; Women&#39;s gifts under-used The October consultation focused on the goals for the year 2000. The international representatives grappled with the question, &quot;How will women have impacted the world for Christ by the end of the century?&quot; They recognized that a major obstacle is the status of women in so much of the world. Because their gifts are often not recognized, many women feel God has no use for them in ministry, or that they have nothing to offer. There is an almost universal longing on the part of key women leaders to be accepted and encouraged by the male leadership of the Church. They desire to be complementary co-laborers in order to hasten the fulfillment of the Great Commission. The leaders also discussed the need for practical, usable research findings so that women at the grassroots level can pinpoint unreached peoples. Some are already finding that skills training or literacy programs are keys to open the doors for evangelism. Clearly, there is a need for a renewed mission involvement by women -- returning to the active missions participation of Western women in the 19th century, but now on a worldwide scale. Dreams for AD2000 The women returned to their countries with these dreams burning in their hearts: Hundreds of thousands of women around the world praying for the lost and unreached. Key women leaders networking together to encourage each other, share resources and models of ministry and cooperating across denominational and para-church organizations. Penetrating at least three unreached people groups in each country with the gospel. (If that goal is reached, women&#39;s networks would see a church planting initiative in at least 10% of all identified unreached peoples by the year 2000.) Multiplying the effectiveness of these goals by bringing men and women together as co-laborers in the harvest. With this challenging task ahead, the leaders of the AD2000 Women&#39;s Track believe God is going to turn their dreams into reality as they faithfully obey Him. Lorry Lutz is the International Coordinator for the AD2000 Women&#39;s Track. You may contact her at: The AD2000 Women&#39;s Track 2860 South Circle Drive, Suite 2139 Colorado Springs CO 80906 USA or call 719-540-0933 An Open Letter from Luis Bush (In a letter to the AD2000 Movement, the leaders of the Women&#39;s Track expressed their commitment to being full and active partners in the AD2000 Movement and mobilizing as many women as possible for active and vital participation in all areas of the movement. Luis Bush, the International Director of the AD2000 and Beyond Movement responded with a letter that encouraged their involvement and explained a little more about the nature of this movement which is unique in its structure and organization. We provide excerpts of this letter here so that both men and women can get a better understanding of what the AD2000 Movement is and how it operates. --Rick Wood) Dear Sisters in Christ: Thank you for your report and recommendation from the AD2000 Women&#39;s Track International Consultation October 4-8, 1993 which I received from Lorry Lutz. As I read through the results of the discussions and dreams for the year 2000 I became excited with the tremendous vitality and potential. I sensed among the leaders of this track with regard to the present world picture and the future. I was greatly blessed and challenged by the fellowship and common heart Doris and I experienced among you at your October meeting. I sensed a strong pursuit of the Lord and desire for His will to be accomplished through women around the world. I share that same heart and desire with you. In relation to your request, I would make the following reflections from my mind and heart. A sense of joy in the statement of the first paragraph of your recommendation that you all have sensed the support and encouragement of the AD2000 Movement. This indeed has been the great desire from the very beginning of this initiative; that God&#39;s women would experience great support, increasing participation and encouragement. It was interesting to me that the document was a recommendation to the AD2000 Movement rather than to any individual. It raises the question in my mind; &quot;What is the AD2000 and Beyond Movement?&quot; I&#39;m not sure if anyone fully understands what it is yet. It was interesting that as people try and define what exactly it is there were several common expressions noted on page two of the handbook such as those made by people in December 1991. Dr. Bong Rin Ro, General Secretary of the World Evangelical Fellowship Theological Commission, emphasized that AD2000 is a &quot;grass-roots&quot; networking structure.&quot; Dr. Bill Taylor, General Secretary of the WEF Missions Commission, calls it a grass-roots movement, a network of networks, a fusion of visions.&quot; Dr. Peter Wagner, professor at Fuller Seminary School of World Missions notes, &quot;We are all controlled from the bottom up rather than from the top down.&quot; Phill Butler of Interdev observes that the AD2000 Movement has a &quot;...focus on catalyzing, mobilizing, and multiplying resources through networks.&quot; What is common in the minds of many who have reflected on this question is that it is grass-roots and controlled from the bottom up, as led by the Holy Spirit. What this means is that in some sense &quot;AD2000 is out of the control of a hierarchical structure&#39;s decision making process.&quot; This, by the way, is not only factual, but intentional. There is a sense in which AD2000 is something which the Holy Spirit has raised up and is doing around the world. In fact, I recall when the women executives from the Lausanne Movement, from WEF and AD2000 met to discuss cooperation, the AD2000 Movement was described as a &quot;fast moving train.&quot; In a real sense, those who wish to be a part of the movement jump onto a train in motion. When they get on board they discover it has its own unique set of peculiarities that those coming on board must recognize and accept. With this in mind, many things are happening within the Movement that neither the various boards or Director have any control over. As you can imagine, while on the one hand this has its strengths, yet, at the same time it also has its weaknesses, as seen from the human-process point of view. One of those weaknesses is in trying to legislate the kind of desires you have expressed for greater involvement of women in the movement. Having made these observations, let me add the following thoughts: As International Director, I agree in concept and principle to your desire greater participation of women. Consequently, I would like to be a partner with you in encouraging AD2000 committees to have &quot;more active participation of women on all levels.&quot; Thus, I plan to seek the support from the International Board, the U.S. Board, Resource Network leaders, Task Force leaders and regional coordinators of the AD2000 movement to encourage AD2000 committees on all levels to invite more women to be a part of the process in these committees. Base actual appointments on qualifications, availability, and commitment to the AD2000 Movement vision and process demands. Seek candidate recommendations from a number of different sources, including the executive Committee of the women&#39;s resource network. Discussions are currently underway to appoint godly qualified women for the position of Honorary chairperson of the AD2000 and Beyond Movement as well as for the International Board and the U.S. Board. I am sending this letter, along with your recommendation, to the primary leaders of the AD2000 &amp; Beyond Movement. In addition, I am bringing this matter up at the upcoming planning meetings in December. May the Lord mightily bless you sisters as you mobilize God&#39;s women around the world.

    "content": "AD2000 Denominational Summit Declaration Avery Willis Jr. We, the attendees of this historic summit meeting, Realizing that God is on a mission to redeem a lost world (II Peter 3:9), and that Christ has given us the Great Commission to make disciples of all nations (Matt. 28:18-20); Having come here in the prayerful conviction that the Spirit of God is leading His Church at this unique juncture of history; and Having heard the reports of denominational initiatives to the year 2000 and beyond, and of resource networks that are cooperating across denominations, churches and organizations to focus on world evangelization, mobilization of united prayer and coordinated efforts to reach the unreached; Believing that the Holy Spirit has led us to be present at this gathering, and having experienced the unity of the multifaceted body of Christ and the unique corporate gifting that different denominations and organizations bring to that body. Now, being of one mind in our commitment to work together for the evangelization of the world by the year 2000 and beyond, we, as individuals from various denominations, declare our joint commitment to seek a church for every people and the gospel for every person by the year 2000. We urgently call the worldwide Body of Christ to join openly in linking hands, hearts, minds and spirits in this grand cause of Jesus Christ. Therefore, we declare, that, upon returning to our respective organizations we will encourage others within our denominations and associations to consider the following actions: To magnify the focus on the people who do not have access to the gospel, the majority of whom live in the area known as the 10/40 Window, without neglecting the mandate for the whole world; To call our people to pray, recognizing prayer as the central strategy that is crucial to this endeavor; to encourage our churches to participate in prayer initiatives, such as Praying Through the Window, the Day to Change the World (on June 25, 1994) and the March for Jesus. To encourage our churches to participate in the national strategy initiatives that incorporate the various AD 2000 networks where they exist, and encourage the development of national strategy initiatives where they do not exist. To seek ways to accelerate the mission thrust of our respective denominations in our work around the world and the recruitment of new missionaries to the unreached. To pursue ways to communicate with and mutually support one another in our common task. To utilize the various networks and task forces of the AD 2000 Movement, where appropriate. As fellow servants of Christ we seek to join with other Christian communities around the world in accomplishing these goals. We make these commitments for the greater glory of Christ our Savior, and the extension of His Kingdom to the millions who have not yet heard.

    "content": "KOREA, Host Country For GCOWE ’95, Sets The Pace In AD2000 National Initiatives Luis Bush Introduction Less than two years from now, the Global Consultation on World Evangelization by the Year 2000 and Beyond, GCOWE &#39;95, will be held here in Seoul, Korea. It is only fitting that the Korean church, as host to this event projected to bring together Christian leaders form some 200 countries has become one of the pacesetters in the development of national AD2000 strategies. Korean AD2000 leader Joon Gon Kim reflected the sense of expectation found in the church in Korea when he said, &quot;We are looking forward to seeing historical, unprecedented, monumental, supernatural and global revival to fulfill the Great Commission taking place in this generation.&quot; From a person who has organized the first meeting in history of over one million Christians during the Seoul Billy Graham Crusade 1973 and then again two years later at Explo 75, Joon Gon Kim, the Korean Director of Campus Crusade for Christ, has gained the respect of Christian leaders throughout Korea as a man of his word. This was apparent as we met with 50 key Christian leaders from the Korean AD2000 Movement on Monday June 21. All the major denominations and local churches in Korea have expressed their support for the AD2000 Movement , calling it &quot;the Movement of the Twenty-First Century.&quot; Why Is the AD2000 Vision So Well-Received? Chairman Kim says: &quot;The Korean church has the potential, willingness and sense of urgency... Koreans want to be unified... The AD2000 Movement will be beneficial, not only for Korean evangelization but also for world evangelization.&quot; Despite the remarkable growth of the Korean church in the seventies and early eighties, in the mind of Korean Christian leaders, it has plateaued. AD2000 has been viewed therefore as a vehicle that can bring revival to the church of Korea, not only to reach the rest of Korea but also the world with the gospel of the kingdom. In fact, they are hopeful that Korea, under God, would become a truly Christian country, and they perceive the AD2000 Movement as making a contribution toward that vision. How Is the AD2000 Vision Being Introduced to the Korean Church? A fast moving video on the AD2000 vision begins with planet earth spinning on its axis and showing the countries of the world through the clouds followed by the dawning of a new day. The scene then shifts to the crucifixion of Christ, followed by that of the event recorded in Matthew 28 with the words of the Great Commission to his followers to &quot;make disciples of the nations.&quot; This was just the introduction of a powerful communication of the AD2000 vision. As the video continues, Dr. Han Kyung Chik, respected Korean leader and Honorary Chairman for the Korean AD2000 Movement (as well as an honorary chairmen of the global AD2000 &amp; Beyond Movement) underscores the cruciality of the hour and the opportunity before the church. He invites Korean Christians to get involved, explaining that the movement involves prayer, evangelism, social transformation and the unity of the church for world evangelization. The process has worked beyond any expectations. In December 1992, 21 journalists representing the major Christian and secular newspapers of Korea were invited to a press conference during which the AD2000 Movement and vision was introduced. Five large scrap books, each with forty pages filled with news articles of the different activities related to the Movement testify to the spread of the vision. Four monthly eight-page Korean AD2000 newsletters have already been produced and circulated among 5,000 carefully selected Christian leaders throughout the countr, keeping them informed about AD2000 activities and news on a national and global level. Today it is said that most Korean pastors know about the AD2000 movement. On December 21st, 1992, 2200 pastors met for a day to hear the explanation and challenge of the AD2000 vision at the beautiful Korean World Mission Center. This is the venue for GCOWE &#39;95, to which 4500 Christian leaders are expected to come from 200 countries. Since then other meetings of pastors and Christian leaders have been held in Chang Won City, (2400) on May 26, 1993, Taegu City (250) on May 25, 1993, Songtan City (174) on April 17, 1993, Yongin city (25) on May 10, 1993 and Chengju City (40) on June 2, 1993 plus six other cities. Their goal is to share the vision with Christian leaders in the 250 largest cities and towns of Korea and to organize AD2000 committees in each one of them. In each of these cities and towns Christian leaders from different denominations are encouraged to establish a citywide AD2000 committee to take the basic elements of the national plan and adapt it to their own city. What Is The National Korean AD2000 Plan? The national AD2000 &amp; Beyond Movement plan in Korea emphasizes several key elements, as noted in the beautiful 27 page 8 1/2 x 11 colored brochure of the Korean Movement. First is the October 1993 &quot;Prayer Through the 10/40 Window&quot; ; second, the &quot;Day to Change the World&quot; June 25, 1994; third is GCOWE &#39;95; fourth, the &quot;March for Jesus;&quot; fifth, the &quot;1-1-1 Prayer Plan&quot;; and the sixth key element is the social implications of the gospel transforming society. 1. October &quot;Prayer Through the Window&quot; Each of the citywide committees will be deciding on how to implement the call to fast and pray through the 10/40 Window countries during October 1993. Several of the 53 Korean AD2000 tracks or resource networks have made additional plans for implementing this call to prayer. The youth track, for example, is encouraging 2000 college students in Seoul to engage in concerted prayer for the 10/40 Window countries between October 3-22. They will then gather on the university campuses for a closing prayer rally involving some 30,000 students in Seoul. 2. &quot;Day to Change the World&quot; on June 25, 1994 Korean Christian leaders hope that this day will be proclaimed by the National Assembly of Korea as the National Day of Prayer. June 25 happens to be the day that Korea was split in two parts, North Korea and South Korea, and thus carries special meaning. Thus, one of the prayer foc the re-unification of South and North Korea. The Korean AD2000 Executive Committee expects that two million Christians will gather for prayer on June 25, 1994 in the Olympic Stadium in Seoul. Everybody will be invited to remain there all night in prayer. 3. GCOWE &#39;95, May 17-26, 1995 Apart from hosting GCOWE &#39;95 at the beautiful Korean World Mission Center, the Korean AD2000 Committee has agreed to raise the expenses for food, housing and internal transportation within Korea for close to 3,000 delegates from the Two- Thirds World. They envision mobilize the churches of Korea by asking each of 5,000 local churches to adopt one of these delegates as a special pray focus between January 1994 and the meeting in May 1995. They will be given a brief testimony and photo of the participant they choose. 4. March for Jesus on June 25, 1994 Two million Koreans are expected to participate in the March for Jesus on June 25. This massive march will have several results: 1) it will give public testimony to Jesus Christ, raising interest in the minds of the general public about the person of Jesus, and 2) it will present to the public the reality of a church united, thus demonstrating the unity of the body of Christ 5. &quot;1-1-1 Prayer Plan&quot; This prayer movement encourages all Korean Christians to pray at 1:00 p.m. every day for one minute.They will pray for 1) for the evangelization of the country and the whole world, 2) for one specific person that they want to be saved, 3) for their pastor and the revival of their church, and 4) for one of the 4,700 districts of 5,000 people each in North Korea. 6. Social Transformation The special issues forum is designed to surface key social issues that the church must face and deal with. The format is a lecture by a person knowledgeable on the subject, followed by a time of questions. To date there have been three forums, beginning in December of 1992. The most recent, held June 12, attracted some 500 people. One of the major projects involves challenging 100,000 students each to adopt and pray for one district of North Korea. The hope is that 10,000 of these students will decide to take one- to two-year breaks from college studies to live as Christ&#39;s personal representatives in the districts for which they have prayed. Their goal: to plant a church there and to serve the community. To date more than 35,000 students have committed themselves to this. Tracks Or Resource Networks Fifty three affinity-group tacks have been formed in the Korean AD2000 Movement. While some are still in the organizational development stage, some appear to have a full head of steam. The Singspiration Track, for example, encourages praising God through singing. Geared mainly to the young, the y plan to have united praise fests in the five largest cities of Korea. On May 5 and 19, singspirations were held in two cities. At one, more than 10,000 participated; at the other more than 20,000. At their five-day scheduled retreat, 50,000 youth are expected. Conclusion Today 35 full-time and part time staff crowd the fifth floor of the Korean Center for World Mission to handle the multiple activities and demands of the growing AD2000 initiatives and preparation for GCOWE &#39;95. All of this was inspired by participating with the global AD2000 &amp; Beyond Movement. Yet the Korean AD2000 Movement initiated their activities and organization only one year ago. It is an inspiration to see the cooperation among the various segments of the Korean church as they work toward a common vision for their country and the world and we commend their generosity in hosting GCOWE &#39;95.

    "content": "National Consultation on the Evangelization of Ghana and Beyond Ross Campbell AD2000 News and Updates New Co-Chairman Named The AD2000 Movement is pleased to announce that four new Honorary Co- Chairmen have been named. They are Billy Graham, Bill Bright of Campus Crusade, Luis Palau, and Kyun Chik Han of Korea. Praying Through the Window Peter Wagner reports that over 20 million people have committed themselves to specifically focused prayer on the 10/40 Window during October 1993. The Christian Information Network reports that over 800 churches have now adopted 10/40 Window countries and 231 prayer teams are planning one week on-site October prayer journeys to every country in the 10/40 Window. Global Survey Launched A global assessment of the unfinished task was launched on July 20 that would include a global survey on the unfinished task. The AD2000 Assessment Task Force was commissioned to undertake this task under the chairmanship of Clark Scalon, Director of Planning and Research of the Foreign Mission Board of the Southern Baptist Convention and Pete Holzmann of Data Serve as the coordinator. There was a common sense of purpose to assemble a unified picture of the unfinished task with the collaboration of all participant organizations in conjuction with the existing research agencies. Ghana Benefits from National Church Survey Accra, June 4, 1993-- Over 600 carefully selected Ghanaian Christian leaders, representing every major Protestant denomination, mission and para-church ministry, assembeled in Accra, Ghana last June. Following an earlier consultation, in June 1989, in which more than 500 Christian leaders met for a national Consultation on the Evangelization of Ghana and Beyond by AD2000, the purpose of the receent meeting was to evaluate progress and plan for completing the unfinished task of evangelizing their nation and the world. The organizing body was the Ghana Evangelism Committee (GEC) under chairman Jude Hama. Many noted outside speakers were brought in for the conference, including William Kumuyi, Bob Waymire, Niyi Gbadu, Reuben Ezemandu, Johan Combrinck and Luis Bush. The budget for direct costs related to the consultation totaled $20,000 of which 80% was covered by sources in the Ghanaian Church, even though Ghana is one of the poorest sub-Saharan African countries. A feature of the first consultation was the release of a National Church Survey focusing on the unfinished task in Ghana. It was the first of its kind, resulting from four years of village by village research. It provided a clear picture of where the church was at and what remained to be done. The second consultation provided a five-year-survey update giving an added perspective on where the church was going. This survey presented the big picture of the church plus close-ups of individual denominations. A remarkably thorough and well illustrated 112-page National Church Survey Update 1993 was presented by GEC Director, Ross Campbell. An added benefit was the establishment of the GEC as a permanent national research infrastructure. While the first survey presented a &quot;still&quot; picture of what had happened, this second survey presented a moving picture. The thoroughness of the ongoing research brought indisputable facts and realities to light. The clarity, measurability and simplicity of the vision of an evangelized Ghana through saturation church planting was biblical, understandable and acceptable to Christian leaders of all denominations. The presence and notable support of Christian leaders from all denominations as well as the cooperation of national and expatriate missionaries together resulted in a keen sense of unity of the body of Christ. The challenges of the unfinished task in Ghana, and the need to face them squarely, encouraged needed changes from traditional and sometimes ineffective forms of Christianity. Denominations and organizations were encouraged to make changes, establish new priorities and take specific action steps in response to the challenges presented. The focus on completing the task in Ghana by the year 2000 introduced a sense of urgency. There was a clear focus on the unreached people groups and unchurched villages and towns. Mobile contextualized training units were established to prepare lay pastors for the thousand of unchurched villages. Networks of women, young people, pastors, etc. were formed to contribute to helping with the unfinished task. The need for a holistic and contextualized approach for effective ministry was underscored. Finally, the importance of fervent , focused prayer was repeatedly emphasized. National Initiative Cross-Fertilization Recently many of you may have received AD2000 news releases from various countries around the world. In the last few weeks the leaders of the AD2000 and Beyond Movement in India, Korea, Australia, and Ghana have sent our very encouraging reports of the progress of their national initiatives. We hope these interlinking streams of communication continue to grow as we all move forward. Creative Partnership Initiatives with the AD2000 Movement John Kyle--Partnership with the Presbyterian Church of America Mission to the World John serves actively and efficiently as the US AD2000 Board Chairman. The US Board of Trustees provides accountability in financial, legal and operational matters, inter-organizational partnership agreements, and policy formation consistent with the directional strategies of the international Board. Paul Cedar--Partnership with the Evangelical Free Church of America Paul Cedar chairs the AD2000 International Coalition of Christian Leaders, which is composed of 200 key leaders from various denominations, national and local churches, mission movements and service entities from around the world. All have a primary commitment to cooperate with other Christians in the vital ministry of world evangelization in the decade of the 1990s. These International Coalition leaders share the vision of the AD2000 and Beyond Movement. They are &quot;front line&quot; leaders, implementors, activists, equippers, and/or mobilizers in the ministry of world evangelization. Coalition members give leadership to the involvement of their own constituencies and share spiritual counsel with the various AD2000 boards, committees and resource network leaders. They will seek to rally support and resources of all kinds to see the objectives of the movement fulfilled. Clark Scanlon--Partnership with the Foreign Mission Board of the Southern Baptist Convention As director of planning and strategy for the Foreign Mission Board of the Southern Baptist Convention, Clark has served as one of five on the Peoples Information Network work team. He participated in the validation of the list of adoptable and unreached people groups published by the Adopt-A-People Clearinghouse and others. He serves as Chairman of the AD2000 Assessment Task Force. Under his direction a global field survey will be launched to assess the status of world evangelization for its initial presentation at GCOWE &#39;95. Bill Bright--Partnership with Campus Crusade for Christ--New Life 2000--The JESUS Film project At Bill&#39;s initiative, extensive discussions and prayer were conducted over an extended period of time to determine creative ways in which New Life 2000, The Jesus Film and AD2000 could cooperate with the AD2000 Movement. As a result, eight specific areas of cooperation were agreed on,perhaps the main one being the incorporation of a resource network on development coordinated by Paul Eshleman under the chairmanship of Victor Koh. Bill Bright now serves as one of the Honorary Co-Chairmen of the AD2000 Movement. William Kumuyi --Partnership with African Independent Churches As regional coordinator for AD2000 Kumuyi launched the movement in Africa in a continent-wide conference in August 1992. More than 12,000 pastors and Christian leaders from over 2,140 African denominations and 45 African countries converged on Lagos for the meeting. Peter Wagner said, &quot;As I have made a mental review of recent church history on all six continents, I cannot recall a similar event which even approaches this one in size, diversity and leadership rank.&quot; William has written to 20,000 pastors throughout Africa, encouraging each to mobilize at least one hundred intercessors for the Prayer Through the Window effort in October 1993. He has received in writing more than 5,000 affirmative responses. Alberto Mottesi Continent-wide Partnership In Latin America, evangelist Alberto Mottesi has spearheaded the formation of Partnership 2000,an implementational task force for the fulfillment of countrywide cooperative efforts throughout Latin America., Partnership 2000 models the principles and results proposed by the AD2000 Movement as an integral part of the movement in Latin America. Montesi says,&quot;We will work so that every congregation established will become a missionary church and that at least 10,000 missionaries will be sent out from countries in Latin America to at least 1,000 unreached peoples.&quot; Alberto serves on the International Board of AD2000 and the Executive Committee of the International Coalition. Kim Joon Gon Country-wide Partnership--Korea AD2000 Kim Joon Gon is the chairman for the Preparation Committee for GCOWE &#39;95. The Korea AD2000 movement represents one of the most all- encompassing AD2000 countrywide intitiatives in the world today. The Korean church will host this mid-decadal assessment gathering, providing food and housing for the nearly 300 Two-Thirds World participants and the necessary internal transportation within Korea amounting to about $2 million. The AD2000 Movement Launched in Australia Over 100 Church leaders, Para-Church representatives and mission organization personnel gathered in Sydney on Thursday, June 24 for the launch of the AD 2000 and Beyond Movement in Australia. The Australian involvement is headed by a steering committee, chaired by businessman Graham Binet, with Mal Garvin as co-ordinator. Behind the effort is the question, Can the world be reached for Jesus by the end of this century? Luis Bush, International Director of the A.D. 2000 Movement believes the answer is yes! Bush spoke at the Queensland launch of the AD 2000 Movement at the Gateway Baptist Church in Brisbane. He called the AD2000 Movement the central catalytic agent for synchronizing the numerous worldwide forces for evangelism that God has been preparing for this time. Bush sees what is happening as a rising river, swelling as Christians around the world flow together, forgetting their differences and focusing on their common goal. As we move towards the year 2000 the river will become a raging torrent, breaking down strongholds and reclaiming nations for Christ. South Korea, says Bush, is a model of what we can expect to see. In that nation, ALL the major denominational leaders are meeting together to plan how the nation&#39;s Christians can be directed to fulfill their part in the AD 2000 vision. Also speaking at the Queensland launch was author and missiologist, Dr. C. Peter Wagner. He said the church has seen an acceleration of growth that has never been seen before. &quot;God is preparing for the final thrust,&quot; he said. He likened this to the final thrust of childbirth - a difficult time that culminates in the greatest victory of all, new life! &quot;What will it take to reach the whole world with the Gospel of Jesus Christ?&quot; asked Dr. Wagner. &quot;Greater understanding of church-growth principles? More advanced evangelism methodologies?&quot; According to Dr.. Wagner, all these are important but secondary. The key, he says is prayer - concerted prayer on a global scale. Rick Ward spoke of his &quot;excitement&quot; at the outreach towards &quot;unreached peoples&quot; and claimed that &quot;We are at a unique place in history.&quot; He urged all Christians to &quot;resource together to see outreach to unreached groups.&quot; Mal Garvin, author and director of the youth ministry Fusion said that Australians have a great role to play in this movement. &quot;The wind is in the gum trees,&quot; he said. &quot;Our unique Australian Christianity will only find its meaning as a collective expression. We need to focus on something bigger than ourselves, like the AD 2000 Movement. That&#39;s when we realize we need each other,We need to recognize we are a special people, and that God has a special purposes for us.&quot; Inquiries about the AD 2000 Movement in Australia should be directed to: AD 2000 &amp; Beyond Australia, 688 Parmatta Road, Croydon NSW 2132, Australia.

    "content": "New Network Established Victor Koh &amp; Paul Eshleman Saturation Evangelism And Small Group Leadership Development Resource Network Introduction In order to accomplish the AD 2000 goals of a &quot;Church for every people and the Gospel for every person&quot;--two primary efforts needed to be part of the plan: We need to intentionally plan how to proclaim the Gospel to every person; We need to train the leaders who will be needed for millions of small groups of new converts. Many of these small groups will become the new churches for which we are praying if the leaders are adequately prepared. Saturation evangelism is most effective when leaders are prepared before hand to contain the harvest. Purpose The purpose of the Saturation Evangelism and Small Group Leadership Development Network is to (1) encourage the development of a saturation evangelism plan for every ethnolinguistic people group and in every Million Population Target Area (MPTA); and (2) to ensure that a leadership training opportunity is available to train the leaders for the groups of new converts that will be reached. Goals To survey organizations currently involved in saturation evangelism, such as the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association, Luis Palau, and others, in order to determine what areas of the world they are targeting for future evangelistic campaigns; and to see what tools, strategies and materials are being used to prepare group leaders for new convert classes. To ensure that a church or organization has taken seriously the responsibility for proclaiming the Gospel in every MPTA in the world, and is committed to doing everything possible to see that become a reality. To ensure that the proclamation of the Gospel is also reaching into every ethnolinguistic people group within that MPTA. To ensure that at least 98% of the people being presented with the Gospel are hearing the message in their mother tongue. To work with the National Research Network to develop a strategic matrix for every MPTA in the world which would list the saturation evangelism methodology most likely to be effective given the current conditions. Planning criteria would be political openness, amount of religious opposition, degree of media sophistication, literacy, etc. To match the equipment, material and financial resources of more affluent countries with those nations that can provide manpower in order to accelerate the task of evangelization. To work in cooperation with the Radio Task Force and the God&#39;s Word and Literature Resource Network to ensure that no area is left uncovered. To maximize the impact of radio broadcast, &quot;JESUS&quot; film showings, Christian literature and Bible distribution and other mass evangelistic efforts through coordination and cooperation. To establish a New Life 2000 Training Center in every area of five million people which can be used by individual churches, denominations, and organizations wishing to develop additional leadership to follow-up their saturation evangelism efforts. To provide New Life 2000 Training to churches and other Christian organizations desiring to equip small group leaders--in at least 300 major languages. To encourage agencies in the more affluent countries to assist not only with evangelistic literature and Bibles but also with urgently needed discipleship and leadership training materials. To conduct conferences with church leaders to emphasize the need to prepare leaders in personal evangelism, follow-up, and discipleship before the evangelistic enterprises are launched. To prepare one thousand small group leaders in every Million Population Target Area who understand the principles of spiritual multiplication found in II Timothy 2:2 and are capable of helping the members of their groups lead others to Christ and follow them up. Measurable Objectives To survey world Christian leaders and organizations to determine what saturation evangelism and small group leadership development tools and plans are currently available by December 31, 1993. To invite 400 delegates interested in saturation evangelism and small group leadership development to the Global Consultation on World Evangelism (GCOWE &#39;95). To determine the current use of the &quot;JESUS&quot; film by country, language, people group, and MPTA--by June 30, 1994. To determine in which country, MPTA or people group the 400 mission organizations currently using the &quot;JESUS&quot; film are working by June 30, 1994. To determine which saturation evangelism efforts are being targeted to the 2000 least evangelized peoples--by June 30, 1994. In cooperation with New Life 2000, to initiate cooperative training programs for small group leaders on five continents by December 31, 1994, in order to develop models which can be explained at the GCOWE conference in 1995. To establish a saturation evangelism office in every area of at least 5 million people which will attempt to provide evangelistic tools, strategies, and materials to churches, denominations and organizations by June 1, 1995. Examples would be the &quot;JESUS&quot; film, traveling evangelists, music and drama groups, etc. The focus will be on mass evangelism activities where a live response to the gospel can be given and interested people followed up. To establish a cooperative effort within every geographic area of 5 million people--by June 30,1996-- that can provide a training opportunity for churches, denominations and organizations who would like assistance in the training of small group leaders. The training and materials will be available in the languages of each people group o more than one million speakers, and increasingly in every people group in this geographic area. Summary Statement The list of elements which should be included in any global plan of evangelism is almost endless. They range from seed sowing, pre- evanglism, and proclamation to discipling, church planting, and theological education. However, as we look toward December 31, 2000, the following statement could capsulize our objectives: To ensure that all people in the world will have an opportunity to hear the Gospel in their &quot;mother tongue&quot; or an understandable language; and, if they respond to the message, become a part of a local church in which they can grow toward maturity. The goal of this network then is twofold: (1) to help ensure that a saturation evangelism effort is launched in every area, and (2) that leaders are developed to disciple the new converts which will respond to the message. With Paul Eshleman as one of the coordinators for this network, Campus Crusade for Christ will clearly play a major role in this network and the overall AD2000 Movement as well. Bill Bright, founder of Campus Crusade said recently in a letter to Luis Bush of the AD2000 Movement: &quot;Let us be prayerfully creative in what we can do in partnership with you and other members of the body of Christ.&quot; Bailey Marks Sr, also working with Campus Crusade, said in a letter to Luis Bush: &quot;I truly sense we are of one spirit and I believe God is going to bless this mutual effort on each of our parts in a very significant way. We all know if the gospel is going to be proclaimed throughout the world by the year 2000, and I believe it will be, that it is going to take more and more of us working together, setting aside our individual rights in order to see the Lord Jesus Christ lifted up before the lost people of the world.&quot; Description of AD2000 and Beyond Movement Resource Networks and Task Forces Mobilization of United Prayer (Peter Wagner)--networking all the existing international and national prayer networks to intercede for the lost, especially the 10/40 Window.

    "title": "A Church for Every People by the Year 2000 - Dream or Reality?",
    "content": "A Church for Every People by the Year 2000 - Dream or Reality? Luis Bush This article was given as a speech at the Adopt-A-People Consultation II in Colorado Springs, April 25-27, 1993. Selected portions of this message are presented here. The dream of Joseph becomes a reality For years God&#39;s people have had dreams that have become realities. The word dream appears 77 times in your New International Version, almost half of those in the first book of the Bible, the book of Genesis, the book of beginnings. Most of the dreams of God&#39;s people in the Bible became realities right on the pages of Scripture. Take Joseph, sometimes called the dreamer. Joseph dreamed of stars and sheaves on the field, bowing down to him. But when he told it to his brothers, they hated him all the more. Even his father rebuked him and said, &quot;What is this dream you had? Will your mother and I and your brothers actually come and bow down to the ground before you?&quot; But the dream did come true. Later when Joseph was asked by Pharaoh to interpret his dream Joseph replied: &quot;The reason the dream was given to Pharaoh in two forms is that the matter has been firmly decided by God, and God will do it soon.&quot; And he did. The dream of Joseph to wed Mary becomes a reality Some 2000 years later and from our vantage point almost two thousand years ago his namesake in the New Testament Joseph had a dream that Mary, whom he was about to marry, had conceived by the Holy Spirit. And it was so that born out of this dream and supernatural union of Mary and the Holy Spirit was the one who himself makes the dreams of God&#39;s people come true--Jesus, the fulfillment of the dreams of so many. The dream of William Carey becomes a reality 200 years ago another of God&#39;s people had a dream. William Carey dreamed of reaching the unreached. He penned this dream in his book, written despite extreme skepticism of established Christian leaders, which he called: &quot;An Inquiry into the Obligation of Christians to Use Means in the Conversion of the Heathen.&quot; In the process God used him to launch the modern era of missions. The dream of Christians around the world of a church for every people and the gospel for every person by the year 2000 Today, thousands of God&#39;s servants are joining in a chorus from all over the world expressing the dream: &quot;A church for every people and the gospel for every person by the year 2000.&quot; The dream is not eschatological closure at the year 2000. The dream is not that Christ is coming again at the year 2000. The dream is a church for every people and the gospel for every person in the Caribbean by the year 2000. The dream is a church for every people and the gospel for every person in all of Europe by the year 2000. The dream is a church for every people and the gospel for every person in all of Latin America by the year 2000, and so on for every region of the world. Can the dream of a church for every people by the year 2000 become a reality? It is my conviction that it can become a reality for the following reasons: 1. God is opening hearts God is superintending global events in our time in such a manner that the hearts of people around the world are increasingly open to the gospel of Jesus Christ. People are more and more recognizing that there is a God-shaped vacuum in their heart that only God can fill. In fact, even the secular world is telling us that. In Time Magazine, on March 30, 1992 there was a four page essay titled: &quot;The Year 2000: Is it the end or just the beginning?&quot; This article was written from an entirely secular perspective. The author was Henry Grunwald, a former U.S. ambassador to Austria, the heart of secular humanistic Western Europe, and former editor-in chief of Time Magazine. The article was punctuated with photos of individuals representing some major ideologies of our time as we approach the year 2000: There is Lenin, Khomeini, Pope Paul II, JFK, and Neil Armstrong on the moon. Grunwald summarizes the article in the introduction when he says: &quot;People feel as if the hand of God were turning a page in human fate. We have a sense of things ending and others beginning.&quot; He mentions three things: First, he says, of course, we are witnessing the end of communism. Perhaps nowhere in the world is this more evident right now than in the former USSR. A collection of sixteen republics with some 300 million people who are wide open to God&#39;s word. Unprecedented financial and personnel and mission resources have been deployed to those parts of the world. Hundreds of mission agencies, thousands of short and long term missionaries and millions upon millions upon millions of dollars have been sent to this part of the world. This is a new initiative of the church around the world, in response to the sovereign working of God superintending the events of our time. Second, we are witnessing the end of nationalism as we have known it and beginning to look for new international arrangements; And third, we are witnessing the end, or at least the decline, of the age of unbelief and the beginning of what may be a new age of faith. This last point is the major thesis of the article and he clarifies his understanding of faith... concluding by saying: &quot;Many people seem to want a faith that is rigorous or demanding, or else more personal... Throughout the Third World, Christian churches especially the Evangelicals are gaining more converts than ever before.&quot; We&#39;re undoubtedly living in a &quot;kairos&quot; moment in church history. Even the secular world acknowledges that God is on the move. 2. The Promises of God&#39;s Word The dream of a church for every people and the gospel for every person by the year 2000 can become a reality because of the promises of the Word of God. The Word of God does indicate that the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the glory of God as the waters cover the sea (Hab. 2:14). In fact the text reinforces the prophetical word by saying: &quot;For the revelation awaits an appointed time; ... Though it linger, wait for it; it will certainly come and will not delay.&quot; The revealed Word of God makes very clear that there will be Christians from every tongue and language and people who are saved as pictured in Revelation 7:9. &quot;After this I looked and there before me was a great multitude that no one could count, from every nation, tribe, people and language, standing before the throne and in front of the Lamb. They were wearing white robes and were holding palm branches in their hands. And they cried out in a loud voice: &#39;Salvation belongs to our God, who sits on the throne, and to the Lamb.&#39;&quot;(Rev. 7:9-10) And again as Jesus spoke to his disciples of the end times he said: &quot;And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole world as a testimony to all nations, and then the end will come&quot; (Mat 24:14). Therefore, it is not a matter of whether these things will happen, they will happen as surely as every other statement of fact in the Scripture has become reality. The question is only: &quot;by when...and who will help carry the message?&quot; 3. Explosive Growth in the Two-thirds World Church We have much to rejoice about when we compare the state of Christianity with that of Carey&#39;s Day. In his Inquiry Into the Obligation of Christians to Use Means for the Conversion of the Heathen, Carey estimated that fewer than one third of the countries of the world had any gospel witness. Today we are not only talking about every country but also every ethnolinguistic people group in every country of the world. When A.T. Pierson and D.L. Moody were encouraging world evangelization by the year 1900, not only was there a lowervratio of Bible-believing Christians to world population, but they were almost entirely located within one geographical sphere and culture(95%). Today, an estimated 80% of Bible-believing Christians live outside of the western world, in multiple cultures across the globe. Church growth expert Peter Wagner says: &quot;We will see the revival...&quot; In Asia, the church is growing phenomenally in China. David Wang of Asian Outreach and collaborating with the AD 2000 prayer track for N. E. Asia says that from the 25,000 decisions per day the estimate is that in China the number of decisions each day has increased to 30,000. In Brazil the growth of the evangelical church has been staggering. The government has been taken aback. According to official census figures, in 1980 there was 12 million Protestant believers; in 1992 the number is up to 35 million. One Protestant church has the second largest communication network in Brazil. In the headlines of a major newspaper the AD 2000 target of just one denomination headlined: fifty million by 2000. Following evaluation of where the church in Africa was at the AD 2000 church growth conference held in Nigeria in August of 1992, the expectation was expressed in the declaration that Africa, south of the Sahara would be majority Christian by the year 2000. 4. Increasing Missionaries from Every Culture The dream of a church for every people and the gospel for every person by the year 2000 can become a reality because of the rapidly increasing growth of missionaries from every culture. Missiologists and historians such as Paul Pierson, have said that: &quot;Cross cultural missions from the Two-thirds World is the great new fact of our time.&quot; Larry Pate in a study prepared for Lausanne II in Manila in 1989, concluded that the mission force in the Two-thirds World, currently over 50,000 is growing at 12% per year and will soon overtake the western mission force. For example, in Brazil, in the last five years the missions force has grown 150% from less than 1,000 to 2,500 cross-cultural missionaries. Not only are these Two-thirds World missions many in number, they are innovative in their methodologies and effective in their development of resources. They are not limited to any one geographical sector but represent a global phenomenon. Already there are more Two-thirds World missionaries in the 10/40 window than western missionaries. What he means is that the people groups to be reached are closer linguistically, culturally, and geographically to the people being sent. 5. The Growing Awareness of Unreached Peoples The dream of a church for every people and the gospel for every person by the year 2000 can become a reality because of the growing awareness of the unreached peoples. When Donald McGavran reviewed the responsiveness of the People Movements in the Punjab with Fred and Margaret Stock who wrote the book by that name, he developed the need to focus on people groups in his book The Bridges of God. Simultaneously in Guatemala, Cameron Townsend was confronted by the Indian who said: &quot;If your God is so great why can&#39;t he speak my language.&quot; Consequently, Wycliffe Bible Translators was started to translate the Word of God in the language of each people. A watershed of the concept of unreached people groups was at Lausanne I in 1974 when Ralph Winter spoke on the subject of cross-cultural evangelism. He made the statement &quot;...there are still 2.4 billion people beyond the range of present efforts of any existing church or mission.&quot; At the closing session of the 1974 gathering --which Time Magazine called the most formidable forum of Christians ever to gather together--Billy Graham picked up on Ralph&#39;s concern when he said: &quot;It is not enough that we witness to our near neighbors, we must cross cultural and linguistic barriers with the Gospel.&quot; All these years the U.S. Center for World Mission has maintained a consistent focus on the unreached peoples which has significantly influenced the way we look at missions. In his capacity as Chairman of the Strategy Working Group of Lausanne and Director of MARC of World Vision, Ed Dayton continued a strong emphasis on the unreached peoples, incorporating practical strategies in the book Planning Strategies for World Evangelization. David Barrett has contributed significantly with his strong emphasis on the unreached peoples and the least evangelized world. John Robb of MARC, World Vision has published materials such as People Group Thinking and traveled extensively throughout the world giving seminars and encouraging God&#39;s people to focus on unreached peoples, increasing awareness in nations around the world. Frank Kaleb Jansen has poured his heart into the Unreached Peoples Map, causing many to think about the unreached peoples. When Jack Frizen, executive director of IFMA for 28 years, was asked to identify the most significant trend in missions during the last twenty years for the Evangelical Missions Quarterly on its twentieth anniversary, he answered: &quot;My choice is the renewed focus on unreached people groups and penetrating the frontiers still remaining.&quot; 6. Growing Momentum Toward the Year 2000 The dream of a church for every people and the gospel for every person by the year 2000 can become a reality because of the growing momentum of initiatives to the year 2000. From the time that Dr. Thomas Wang, founder and International Board Chairman of the AD 2000 &amp; Beyond Movement, wrote an article titled, &quot;The Year 2000, Is God Trying to Tell Us Something?&quot; national initiatives of Christian leaders have been increasing around the world. I have just returned from the Caribbean. Gerry Seale, appointee as General Secretary of the Evangelical Association of the Caribbean and regional coordinator of the AD 2000 &amp; Beyond Movement wrote in the press release of the meetings: &quot;... the Caribbean is moving rapidly to implement these strategies and to challenge evangelical leaders to become involved in ensuring there is a church for every people and the gospel for every person by the year 2000.&quot; The declaration drafted by Rev. Peter Garth, President of the Jamaica Association of Evangelicals and affirmed by evangelical Christian leaders of nine countries in the Caribbean read in part: &quot;We commit ourselves to be used by the Lord to bring about revival in our region, not as a catchword but as a reality, in light of AD 2000-- revitalizing, reawakening, renewing, and rekindling the Evangelical Church through: Prayer, communication, and information A new appreciation of our resources, and A new inner burning for the things of God. We commit ourselves to the goal of a Church for every people and the Gospel for every person by the year 2000. We commit ourselves to follow-up on this AD 2000 &amp; Beyond Meeting with a view to establishing prayer committees, task forces, research teams, mobilization teams, goal setting, consultation and cooperation programs. We commit ourselves to network other Christian leaders within the Caribbean with the same vision for world evangelization by AD 2000.&quot; Following up from the African continent-wide AD 2000 consultation in August last year, Zaire held a national consultation in the midst of a national crisis of enormous proportions this January. A single banana costs one million zaires. Monday, Wednesday and Friday are &quot;dead&quot; days when no one would work and there is no public transportation. Despite the upheaval about 350 delegates attended, mostly leaders in Zaire&#39;s 63 denominations of the national AD 2000 consultation, led by Every Home for Christ national leader Diafwila. Their vision called: &quot;All for Christ&quot; seeks to mobilize God&#39;s people at the grass roots for participation in prayer, outreach, discipling and church planting. Of the 350 delegates, 133 had earlier been named to ...tracks which they call &quot;branches.&quot; Veteran missionary Willys Braun who was present reported what goes on to observe the value of the &quot;branches.&quot; &quot;As I compare this national diversification of leadership focus with the old idea that the brain of the denominational president alone must contain and closely control every aspect of ministry in the life of the churches, I see great possibilities for the spiritual enrichment of the Church in the next eight years.&quot; Lorry Lutz has just returned from a consultation for women of the South Pacific in cooperation with the Lausanne Committee. That followed on the heals of a meeting of 100 women from 24 denominations in Nigeria to focus on the AD 2000 vision. This week there is an AD 2000 consultation for women throughout Eastern and western Europe coordinated by Elizabeth Mittelstadt. We should not forget that women represent 60% of the active members of the Body of Christ and 80% of our prayer warriors. Like the women&#39;s resource networks, AD 2000 National and regional consultations by the ten resource networks are going on in many parts of the world this year. Results are also becoming more and more evident. In the Philippines in 1974, with the encouragement of Jim Montgomery of DAWN Ministries, they set a goal of going from 5,000 to 50,000 local churches by the year 2000. As of December 1992 they were on track toward the target with over 31,000 local churches accounted for so far. Momentum is increasing. The process is moving from vision and awareness to major prayer initiatives to mobilization. 7. Mobilization of Prayer for the Unreached The dream of a church for every people and the gospel for every person by the year 2000 can become a reality because of prayer mobilization focused on the unreached At the international consultation on the unreached with some 350 people sponsored last year by Regent Univers- ity, serious thought was given to reaching the unreached peoples with tracks on Islam, Hinduism and Tribals. Experts in these areas provided historical and present perspectives, models and strategies of reaching these unreached people groups. The concluding resolution was stated as follows: &quot;We need to continue building on previous foundations in reaching the unreached because we recognize that the real battle for world evangelization is against the principalities and powers which can only be overcome by united prayer and the use of spiritual weapons and because the Great Commission can best be accomplished by the total involvement of the Body of Christ. We therefore resolve with all evangelical movements to commit ourselves to personal and corporate prayer, to fast, to plan and to mobilize for a joint spiritual effort in October, 1993 together with an expected one million Christians from around the world for the loosening of strongholds and spiritual breakthroughs among the unreached.&quot; Observing what God did with Marxism and recognizing that it will take more than sending a few more missionaries, there is a growing mood of prayer involvement by churches around the world to penetrate the strongholds of the 10/40 Window. The 10/40 Window refers to the imaginary belt between 10 degrees and 40 degrees north of the equator, and extending from Western Africa across the Middle East to Asia. In a count of the populations of unreached people groups in the list of 2000 unreached people groups of the World Evangelization Data Base, it was found that over 80% of the individuals living in these people groups live in the 10/40 Window. &quot;Every Home for Christ has already contacted our 70 global offices encouraging their involvement in helping alert EHC&#39;s estimated 250,000 global prayer partners to not only fast at least one day per week during that month, but to help form thousands of small prayer groups who&#39;ll meet at least once a week during October, 1993, to specifically target the 10/40 Window.&quot; &quot;I am excited to see the almost 500,000 women identified with Women&#39;s Aglow International in 2500 chapters scattered across 105 nations become involved with this bold campaign to focus prayer on the 10/40 Window.&quot; Jane Hansen, vice-chairperson of Praying Through the Window. In fact as she met with almost 5000 from Women Aglow across the United States a few months ago, there was a lengthy time of prayer and consecration. They committed to mobilize one million women around the world for this initiative and took an offering on the spot for $40,000 for the prayer initiative through Women Aglow. A letter and prayer package was sent in February to 20,000 ministers in Africa encouraging each one to mobilize 100 members of their congregations for the October prayer through the window. Throughout the world, Christians are joining in to the global prayer initiative. Already over 71 local church and mission agency teams have indicated they will be traveling for one week for on-site prayer and fasting in one of the 62 countries in the 10/40 Window in October [125 teams as of May 23, 1993]. One intercessory team alone is planning on one hundred intercessors. Over 40 of the countries have been adopted for prayer. 8. Growing Networks The dream of a church for every people and the gospel for every person by the year 2000 can become a reality because of growing cooperation and partnership with networks of different kinds being established around the world by interest areas. Over lunch we asked Peter Nanfelt, international vice president of the Christian and Missionary Alliance, the question about the changes with respect to the U.S. churches in world evangelization. He answered something interesting: &quot;There is more expectation that world evangelization is actually possible.&quot; It has moved within the realm of possibility. There is a sense today of the doability of the task. One hundred years ago there was a similar vision for the evangelization of the world by the end of the century. However, in 1895, it was AT Pierson who said: &quot;We despaired of hope.&quot; The two primary reasons he gave, were, first, because we did not mobilize prayer and second because we did not cooperate. Both of those factors appear to be strongly on the increase today. Christian mission has always faced a future demanding constant adaptation to change. But the contemporary communication revolution has brought unprecedented challenges to the church around the world. Many church and mission leaders now believe that genuine partnerships is the only way to take advantage of the opportunities presented by this last decade of the century and millennium, as we move into a new century and millennium. This was the conclusion of a working consultation on Partnership in World Mission that was held at the Billy Graham Center in Wheaton, May, 1991 cosponsored by the EFMA. Another major partnership consultation was held at the World Evangelical Fellowship Missions Commission gathering last year, coordinated by Bill Taylor. Bill Waldrop and ACMC took partnership as its primary theme last year. Both the discussion and the reality of Christian partnership and cooperation in world evangelization has taken enormous strides in the U.S., marking another change in the role of the church in the U.S. in world evangelization. Phill Butler of Interdev has had many years of experience in developing 12 operating strategic level partnerships among the most unreached peoples of the world. In seeing the growing interest in partnership, Interdev is transferring that expertise in training sessions to potential multinational facilitators of future strategic level partnerships, particularly in the 10/40 Window. The specific goal Phil has established in the Partnership Task Force of the AD 2000 &amp; Beyond Movement is to have a partnership going in every one of the major unreached people groups by the year 2000. Then there is the former Soviet Union. Public school officials and others have invited Christian ministries to fill the spiritual vacuum left by seventy years of Marxist tyranny. The opportunity here, with the invitation given--enter the CoMission, now representing over 80 Christian organizations and millions of dollars for on-site training and assistance. Again, the opportunity here, with the invitation given--enter CBN with remarkable numbers of decisions, an estimated 30 million according to surveys, 5 million written inquiries, 1000 requests for correspondence courses per day. CBN in conjunction with Regent University and AIMS offered to partner with any evangelical mission working in the former USSR. They even offered sharing the decision cards. Now they are in the process of holding 40 major church planting rallies across the former USSR. The opportunity here, the invitation given--enter AD 2000 with a consultation with national Christian leaders from the former USSR. Out of it comes a commitment to plant the church throughout the land so that there will be a church for every people and the gospel available to every person by the year 2000. Out of it comes a Master Alliance of more than thirty six Christian church planting organizations and a budget of some 20 million dollars. Dan Scribner, information manager for the AD 2000 &amp; Beyond Movement has informed me that already there are some 4500 Christian leaders in more than 150 countries that have been recommended to link with the global networks. Each of the ten AD 2000 related networks have an average of some 100 countries of the world that are being networked together along that interest area, or &quot;branch of the vine,&quot; as our friends from Zaire would suggest. 9. Peoples Information Network The dream of a church for every people and the gospel for every person by the year 2000 can become a reality because of the peoples information network with its commitment to assessment A major contribution for that is the completion of the Registry of Peoples and Languages (also called ROPAL) by SIL. The registry provides a crucial link in the understanding of the task of a church for every people: By giving a standard means of comparison between the various names given to peoples and languages in a variety of databases. By establishing agreed codes which will facilitate the exchange of information between databases. By developing means of pointing to other types of information, such as bibliographic sources. By providing a list of peoples and languages with codes, so that the creation of any new databases related to peoples and/or languages can be compatible with existing information sources. In addition, following several years of evaluation, the development of several independent information bases, and months of preparation, an Ad Hoc Group committed to providing the information and information tools on peoples and people groups around the world to serve the Body of Christ in the task of world evangelization began meeting in the Fall of 1992. Coordinated by Ron Rowland, the group seeks to lay the foundation for an ongoing information system about peoples, their languages and habitats to; 1). Provide the information and information tools on peoples around the world to serve the Body of Christ in the task of world evangelization, and 2). to monitor the goal of a church for every people by the year 2000. 10. Adopt-A-People The dream of a church for every people and the gospel for every person by the year 2000 can become a reality because of the work of mission agencies and the Adopt-A-People Clearinghouse in producing a List Of Unreached And Adoptable People Groups. The Adopt-a-People Clearinghouse was established in March 1989 on the campus of William Carey International University in a gathering of leaders of 48 mission agencies who recognized the need for an independent clearinghouse that would have an exclusive focus on the unreached peoples. The Adopt-A-People Clearinghouse has continued to grow to over 75 agencies today. With the active participation of the mission agencies supplying over 3000 names of people groups considered to be unreached and other entities that participated in the validation and assessment process they are about to fulfill the first of its threefold commission: to compile a global database of unreached peoples to track which peoples are unreached. More than 125 documents representing 182 countries were sent back in response to the first draft of the listing. Since then continual efforts have gone in to validating the list of unreached and adoptable peoples. They have a proper name and a location. Thank God for the persevering efforts of Kaleb Jansen; with the support of Terry Riley and Dan Scribner we have a significant working document in our hands today. Ron Rowland of SIL and Clark Scanlon of the Foreign Mission Board of the Southern Baptist Convention with their respective staffs have reviewed every one of the 6500 or so people groups. The remarkable World Evangelization Database produced by David Barrett under the FMB of the SBC has served as a verifier of the list of unreached peoples. In addition, the recently completed SIL production of the Registry of Peoples and Languages has greatly enabled the validation process of a list of unreached peoples. You will see a ROPAL code on most of the people groups in the listing. This constitutes a major breakthrough into a new era of world missions. We have never had this before. It provides a specific prayer target and deployment target for missionaries. We have had guesses before; now we have knowledge, even though still imperfect. It makes a church for every people by the year 2000 become a measurable goal. As Rick Wood, the managing editor of Mission Frontiers Magazine of the U.S. Center for World Mission, wrote recently to Kaleb Jansen in relation to the special adopt-a-people issue of Mission Frontiers : &quot;For many years now the evangelical church has been offered various numbers when it comes to estimates of the total number of unreached people groups in the world. The first estimate was 16,750 which was rounded to 17,000 to dispell the confusion that a specific list of identified unreached peoples existed. The estimate was then lowered to 12,000 and now 11,000. Many have inferred from this that great progress was being made and that a specific list of unreached peoples existed from which groups were removed as they were reached. But this kind of measurable progress has little to do with the changing of numbers. The numbers changed as missiologists changed their estimates. &quot; Today, however, we do have a working list of almost 5,300. And this includes a more detailed breakdown of people groups by state in India. If India were held consistently with the rest of the book it would be closer to 4,500. If you were to ask Patrick Johnstone, who has perhaps done more research on the work among the unreached people groups he will say there are only 700. Kaleb Jansen agrees with that estimate, calling these &quot;untouched.&quot; Now, even though still a working document and imperfect, we now have for the first time a target list by which we can actually assess the progress of a church for every people by the year 2000. Conclusion A dream was born articulated by Chairman, Sir Culling Eardley Smith at the inaugural meeting of what developed into the World Evangelical Fellowship back in August 1846 when he said: &quot;It is the first experiment which has been made to combine together the interest of truth and love.&quot; It was a dream that, while faltering, never died as the book by David Howard on the birth and growth of the World Evangelical Fellowship was titled: &quot;The dream that would not die.&quot; So today, the dream of a church for every people by the year 2000 has never been brighter since first it became a resounding cry out of the global frontier missions conference in 1980. We might ask along with Henry Grunwald in his article in Time Magazine on &quot;The Year 2000: Is it the end or the beginning,&quot; &quot;Where will all this lead...? Just possibly to a real new age of faith.&quot; In July of 1989, 3,000 representatives from 170 countries came together. In the Manila Manifesto resulting from that meeting, the question was posed, &quot;Can we commit ourselves to evangelize the world during the last decade of the millennium?&quot; That is the question before us in this crucial consultation.

    "content": "The Mother of All Challenges in the Middle East Luis Bush International Briefing on the Middle East What is the “mother of all challenges” for the World Christian? Few Christians, who are concerned with world evangelization by the year AD 2000, would disagree that the most crucial challenge we confront is the Arab Middle East. The 220 million Arab Muslims of the Middle East and North Africa represent &quot;the core of the core&quot; ~ the most challenging region within the 10/40 Window. It is within this hardened territory that the seeds of extreme Islamic fundamentalism have taken root and grown ruggedly strong. Militant factions in this part of the Muslim world have increasing dominance, and other nations have felt their fury. The recent bombing of the World Trade Center brought the reality of this hostility into the American living room. Of course, the vast majority of Arab Muslims are not fanatical terrorists, but rather individuals whose minds have been blinded by Satan. As a group, they represent the largest and most unreached ethnic block in the Muslim world; and, while most governments in Arab countries remain hostile to any form of Christian mission, other things in the Middle East are rapidly changing. Deeply rooted myths are being destroyed, particularly the falsehoods that &quot;the Arab world is unreachable&quot; and that &quot;God does not care about Muslims.&quot; One worker in the Middle East has been quoted as saying, &quot;Militant Islam is certainly the&#39;strongman&#39; that must be bound if the Muslim world is going to be plundered for the Kingdom! It is time for the Arab world to be recognized as reachable and for it to rise to the top of mission agendas.&quot; Presently, only less than 0.4% of global Christian mission budgets is going to evangelize the Middle East and North Africa. However, there are evidences of spiritual revival among Christians in the Middle East. I recently attended a special gathering in the Middle East, which focused on the &quot;mega-trends&quot; and &quot;priority ministry tasks&quot; within the Arab Middle East, and I can assure you that much of the news is very encouraging. Now, on Saturday, June 5th at Village Seven Presbyterian Church in Colorado Springs, Colorado another significant meeting will be held, which is being called an, &quot;International Briefing on the Middle East.&quot; Some of the most knowledgeable and prominent Arab Christian leaders from the Middle East will be present at this strategically important gathering: Maher Fouad Rizk, General Secretary of the Evangelical Alliance of Egypt; Menes Abdul Noor, pastor of the largest evangelical church in Egypt; Victor Hashweh of Jordan and Lucien Accad of Lebanon, who are the International Secretary and Chairman, respectively, of the newly formed Arab World Evangelical Ministers&#39; Association (AWEMA). Tom Craig, Middle East Area Director for Interdev, will provide an informed and up-to-date picture of what is happening in the Middle East. He recently conducted an extensive, nine-month survey of the Arab world. AWEMA serves as the evangelical association for Arab pastors and ministers throughout the Arab world. This meeting will provide an excellent opportunity for American Christians to interact with some of the key evangelical Christian leaders of the Middle East. This gathering also presents a golden opportunity for Christians in the U. S. to become informed about the facts--to hear the testimonies of God&#39;s power at work in the Arab Muslim world--to understand the trends and the times in which we live--and to learn specifically how to be involved. My own recent exposure to these realities has dramatically affected my life and ministry. Rev. Bernie Kuiper, senior pastor of Village Seven Presbyterian Church and the hosting pastor for the event, says, &quot;I believe that the Muslim world is the most neglected mission field today. Yet, in a way, they are closer to receiving the truth of the Gospel than other major populations. This is a unique opportunity to become aware of fields that are ripe for harvest. Village Seven is delighted to host this briefing on the Middle East.&quot; The following organizations and churches have already committed to co- sponsor this special event: New Life Church, Christian Information Network, AD 2000 &amp; Beyond Movement, DAWN Ministries International, Every Home for Christ, God&#39;s Word and Literature Resource Network of AD 2000, Women&#39;s Network of AD 2000, Praying Through the Window, Village Seven Presbyterian Church, Interdev, Caleb Resources, Adopt-A- People Clearing House, Saturation Church Planting Resource Network of AD 2000. It is the hope of each participating organization that this strategic meeting will lead to clearer steps to evangelizing the Arab world by the year AD 2000.

    "content": "The Caribbean Commits to “A Church for Every People by AD2000” Luis Bush As the last region to adopt the strategies of the AD 2000 &amp; Beyond Movement, the Caribbean is moving rapidly to implement these strategies and to challenge Evangelical leaders to become involved in ensuring there is a church for every people and the Gospel for every person by the year 2000. Key Evangelical leaders from nine Caribbean countries and territories came together in Barbados with Luis and Doris Bush, April 12-14, for extensive discussions on the AD 2000 strategies. Several key problems facing the region were identified. These included: Increasing economic problems as small island states grapple with severe economic restructuring programs which seem to be contributing to growing unemployment (as much as 70% in some instances) and the eradication of the middle class. High levels of sexual immorality with many Caribbean countries grappling with more than 60% (in some cases as high as 85%) of their children being born outside of marriage. A continuing breakdown of family units, with the divorce rate reaching one in every three marriages in some countries. Increasing incidences of drug abuse, with related increases in violent crime. Unacceptably high levels of child and spouse abuse. The increasing marginalization of men as women lead the households (46% in Barbados) and are beginning to dominate the secondary and tertiary educational institutions, increasingly coming to the forefront of management and leadership. The failure of the Caribbean as a region and a people to embrace Christ&#39;s mandate to disciple the nations. The high level of division among Evangelicals. The high instances of witchcraft--known in the region as voodoo or obeah. The leaders noted that many of these problems provided a climate highly conducive to the spread of the Gospel of Jesus Christ. Haiti now reports more than 30% of the population being born again, while Jamaica is experiencing a move of God&#39;s Spirit akin to a revival with some 17,000 decisions being recorded in a Luis Palau crusade earlier this year. Barbados also reported increasing numbers of converts to Christ, though currently at much lower levels than Haiti and Jamaica. At the conclusion of the AD 2000 meeting, participants--all of whom are now confirmed as either National Coordinators or Regional Resource Network Chairmen--issued a declaration affirming their commitment to the strategies of the AD 2000 &amp; Beyond Movement. The declaration read in part: &quot;We commit ourselves to be used by the Lord to bring about revival in our region, not as a catch-word but as a reality, in light of AD 2000 - revitalizing, re-awakening, renewing, and rekindling the Evangelical Church through: 1) Prayer, communication, and information, 2) A new appreciation of our resources, and 3) A new inner burning for the things of God.&quot; &quot;We commit ourselves to the goal of a Church for every people and the Gospel for every person by the year 2000.&quot; &quot;We commit ourselves to join the millions of Christians around the world in the 10/40 Window focus during October 1993, in order to broaden the missionary vision of our people for world evangelization.&quot; &quot;We commit ourselves to follow-up on this AD 2000 &amp; Beyond Meeting with a view to establishing prayer committees, task forces, research teams, mobilization teams, goal setting, consultation and cooperation programs.&quot; &quot;We commit ourselves to network with other Christian leaders within the Caribbean with the same vision for world evangelization by AD 2000.&quot; &quot;We commit ourselves to participate in the activities related to the Day to Change the World, June 25, 1994 with special emphasis on being a part of the prayer with fasting for the 10/40 Window as well as the special needs of the Caribbean.&quot; This is one more significant step forward to the goal of a Church for every people and the Gospel for every person by the year 2000. Caribbean Declaration Introduction We the Participants from the Caribbean came together in Barbados for the AD 2000 and Beyond Movement meeting with Rev. Luis Bush (International Director) and Rev. Gerry Seale (Regional Coordinator). We identify ourselves as a group of Evangelical Leaders who are deeply committed to the task of the Evangelization of the Caribbean. We met to examine the political, social, economical and spiritual condition of each country within the region, in light of AD 2000 and beyond. We acknowledge that the enormous and diverse problems we face in the Caribbean region are due in part to the fact that we have not been aggressive enough in executing the mandate of the Great Commission. We acknowledge our weaknesses, especially in the area of unity among denominations and even Local Churches. We have identified the fact that we all face very serious moral decadence in each island, but we thank God for the work of the Holy Spirit in adding thousands to the Evangelical community so that there has been a remarkable growth of the church during the past two years. We consider that we are living in a very special time in the history of the Church in this region as we move toward the year 2000, and we confirm that God has given to His servants the vision of AD 2000. We affirm that we are prepared to participate with believers from other cultures in seeing a Church for every people and the Gospel for every person by the year 2000. We recognize the tremendous importance of prayer as a primary strategy for fulfilling this awesome task of reaching the unreached peoples of the world for Christ. Furthermore, we unite together for this purpose of evangelism and intercessory prayer recognizing that God is able, available, and willing to answer prayer. We commit ourselves to be used by the Lord to bring about revival in our region, not as a catch-word but as a reality, in light of AD 2000 --revitalizing, re-awakening, renewing, and rekindling the Evangelical Church through: a) Prayer, communications, and information. b) A new appreciation of our resources. d) A new inner burning for the things of God. We commit ourselves to the goal of a Church for every people and the Gospel for every person by the year 2000. We commit ourselves to join the millions of Christians around the world in the 10/40 Window focus during October, 1993 in order to broaden our vision for world evangelization. We commit ourselves to follow-up on this AD 2000 meeting with a view to establishing prayer committees, task forces, research teams, mobilization teams, goal setting, consultation and cooperation programs. We commit ourselves to network other Christian leaders within the Caribbean with the same vision for world evangelization by AD 2000. We commit ourselves to participate in the activities related to the Day to Change the World, June 25, 1994 with special emphasis on being a part of the prayer with fasting for the 10/40 Window, as well as the special needs of the Caribbean. In conclusion, we the participants who agree to the above declaration, affirm our relentless commitment to the Great Commission and the mandate of the AD 2000 and Beyond Movement. We are leaving this meeting with a burden for the purpose of AD 2000 to be fulfilled. Drafted by Rev. Peter Garth, President, Jamaica Association of Evangelicals and affirmed by: Rev. Frederick Coombs, President, Trinidad and Tobago Council of Evangelical Churches. Rev. Duthene Joseph, Haiti. Rev. Kenneth Thijm, Curacao. Rev. George Phillips, St. Thomas. Rev.

    "title": "The AD2000 Movement: Who are Bush and Wang?",
    "content": "The AD2000 Movement: Who are Bush and Wang? Roberta Winter George Verwer just called me a few minutes ago from London. He is in the midst of writing an article about the AD2000 challenge of the Unreached Peoples. He said something like, &quot;Ralph, you should have heard me last night talking about reaching all of the Unreached Peoples by the year 2000, the 10/40 Window, the concept of &#39;closure,&#39; and all that. You would have been proud of me!&quot; Well, I have for many years been &quot;proud&quot; of George Verwer--for his dogged faithfulness to the toughest commands of the Living Lord. He and his marvelous movement, Operation Mobilization, have not been calling young people into a life of luxury--but to the ends of the earth, to achievement, to glory, not to personal goals and the soft life. But he surely didn&#39;t get all this inspiration from me--although he said he is reading Mission Frontiers. The 10/40 Window concept is Luis Bush&#39;s creation. The entire &quot;AD2000 Movement&quot; owes greatly to Luis&#39;s faithful executive management, working along with Thomas Wang, whose faith brought this movement into being. Who are Bush and Wang? This issue highlights the AD2000 Movement, as well as being our annual catalog issue. I truly believe these two men are the spearhead of the largest, most pervasive global evangelical network ever to exist. The AD2000 Movement is a network larger than the World Evangelical Fellowship, as superb as that is, larger than the Lausanne Committee, as marvelous as that is, and larger than the World Council of Churches as extensive as that is. What more can I say? No movement has ever enlisted the collaboration of more evangelical leaders in more countries and more key places in the history of the world! Yet the AD2000 Movement has no big central office, has practically no full-time workers, but is essentially a network. (To see what &quot;network&quot; means go to pages 5 and 6 where John Robb of World Vision MARC gives a magnificent description.) But, why did George call? He is concerned to know for sure how many groups we need to go after by the year 2000. So are you. So are we. It is pretty simple: The number of remaining groups to reach depends on how inclusive are the groups you name. For example, how about a list of three categories? What?--you say. Yes, you can include every person in the world by &quot;listing&quot; just three categories: white, brown, black. All of the groups in the world are in there somewhere. Or, suppose you are Wycliffe Bible Translators: you want to list how many teams of Bible translators are needed to reach everyone in the world with the Word of God in print. Wycliffe people are very professional at going into an area (like southern Sudan) and estimating the need for &quot;50 translation projects.&quot; However, suppose you are Gospel Recordings, and you want to reach every person in southern Sudan with the Gospel on audio cassettes. In that case, truly professional workers have come up with the need for 120 recording projects. Who&#39;s right? Wycliffe or Gospel Recordings? Don&#39;t worry. They are both right. It just so happens that the use of audio media brings out key dialect differences which are helpfully disguised when a language is reduced to writing. Wycliffe can reach more people with one of their breakthroughs. Gospel Recordings specializes in a simpler medium of communication (people don&#39;t need to learn to read) but one that requires more detailed attention to different dialects. Both approaches are highly strategic. One more example--this is where I am most of the time. Suppose you want to talk about the most important single goal of a mission agency: the planting of a church movement within a pioneer or frontier people. In that case, the measuring device is even more subtle. Just as Wycliffe has to wait until the New Testament is in print and in use to make sure just how many dialects it can span, so church planters have a similar but more subtle task--to see whether the breakthrough to one group will penetrate nearby, slightly different groups. Wycliffe can come very close, but cannot be absolutely sure. So it is with the number of church-planting breakthroughs necessary to &quot;reach&quot; all peoples by the year 2000. We must be content with (pretty accurate) estimates until the work is done! &quot;Make up your mind. Is it 5,500 or 11,000?&quot; (That is what some are asking --the Adopt A People Clearinghouse now has a valuable book out with about 5,500 peoples listed.) Answer: No, you make up your mind. For example: Do you want to know how many translation projects using print media are still necessary? Barbara Grimes (Wycliffe&#39;s expert) will give you a reliable estimate--3,775. Do you want to know how many translation projects are needed using audio media? Ross Lange (a Gospel Recordings expert) will give a reliable estimate, about 7,500. Do you want to know how many pioneer mission breakthroughs are necessary? This is the business of the church-planting missions. However, while both Wycliffe and Gospel Recordings are aiming at the whole world with their particular tool of communication, any one mission agency is probably too busy planting churches in certain specific places to have time to be counting how many groups there still are in other places.) But, in fact, this third question is the ultimate question. Only if you plant a church movement in a group can you enable every person to become part of a fellowship of believers within his own society. Take your pick: less larger groups or more smaller groups So what is the number that goes with the third question? Well, sorry, no research office I know is prepared as yet to make a solid estimate. Why? Because the other questions have been around longer. Researchers can tell you about the written-language question--that produces larger (but therefore fewer) groups. Or they can tell you about the oral-language question--that produces smaller (but more numerous) groups. But this third question--the &quot;ultimate&quot; question-- was first highlighted in a large meeting of specialists only in 1982. It zeros in on a newly emphasized factor: what is the &quot;reach&quot; of a church movement? This would seem to be even more subtle and sensitive a question than written or oral language use. But it is crucial. My personal estimate of 11,000 groups is an adjustment down from 12,000--a number accepted by the Lausanne Statistics Task Force in 1989. This change is to take into account progress. The good news is that the various lists probably encompass almost all the same peoples. A recent Adopt-A-People disk underlying the estimate of 5,500 includes several groups larger than 50 million. Some of these large groups clearly contain over 100 groups that need separate mission penetration. If very many of the groups listed in a list of 5,500 represent clusters, it is then not hard to imagine a total of 11,000. Just remember: even 11,000 is still a small number in comparison to the vast global spiritual work force that is growing like the wind--the wind of the Spirit! The most important question is not whether or not we can effectively reach all these groups by the year 2000 but whether we are willing to try. It is better to try and fail than to fail to try! And that leads to the question: What happened at the April 25-27 Colorado Springs &quot;Consultation II&quot; of the Adopt A People Clearinghouse (AAPC) which you highlighted in the last issue? This was a great step forward for the concept of local congregations adopting specific people groups which do not yet have a vital church movement among them. The day of the conference, the AAPC published a book, A Church for Every People, listing about 5,500 peoples, big and small. Just about every remaining Unreached People in the world is probably there somewhere, even if part of a larger group listed. We will give the details in our next issue. We can tell you in advance that a truly excellent affirmation came out of this exciting group of about 230 people who gathered at the Colorado Springs Sheraton Hotel. Called &quot;An Appeal to Disciples Everywhere,&quot; it is patterned after a similar statement 100 years ago, drafted by a committee including Dwight L. Moody, A. T. Pierson, and J. E. K. Studd (older brother of C. T. Studd). We will print the Colorado Springs statement in full next time. (We do not yet have the text in its final form.) The committee producing this statement consisted of Clark Scanlon, Southern Baptist Foreign Mission Board Ron Rowland, Wycliffe Bible Translators Bruce Camp, Church relations secretary for the Evangelical Free Church of America Luis Bush, Director of the AD2000 Movement --as well as myself, although I was more of a consultant than a writer of the document. What happened to the announcement last time that the Perspectives Course now has a new version of a seminary education that can be studied anywhere in the world without a classroom? We now have more than 1,000 letters offering mentoring assistance or asking for information for potential students. We now have applications from students in New York, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Michigan, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Nebraska, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Texas, Colorado, New Mexico, California, Hawaii, India, Japan, Korea, Mexico, England, South Africa, and Singapore. The 1,000+ letters of inquiry, of course, come from far more places. As of today, May 11, we have completed 36 three-hour study packages comprising about half of the first of the four semesters. These packages (five per week) include a 15-minute cassette introducing the subject for the day, two hours of reading involving writing answers to several &quot;Reflection Questions,&quot; and a final 15-minute cassette giving a review and definitive reply to the questions posed. A Saturday meeting with a mentor and a Sunday presentation of highlights of the week&#39;s material rounds out the average &quot;study week.&quot; One week out of every four is &quot;vacation.&quot; Twenty-three carefully chosen textbooks constitute a basic library for the first semester, ten of which will be used (along with additional texts) in the subsequent semesters. Four semesters make their way from ancient times in four giant steps to the present, interweaving the vital elements of a seminary education, a liberal arts college degree, plus state-of-the art math, science, and mission perspective. The four half-time semesters add up to a 32-semester-unit M.A. degree. A number of highly qualified professors are dealing with the wide range of interwoven topics. We are audio and video taping every morning at 5:30 AM, getting up often at 3:15 for advance preparations. For further information, write Steve Burg, 1605 E. Elizabeth Street, Pasadena CA 91104, or fax him at 818-398-2111. You can start the first Monday of any month! What about the resumption of the &quot;Million Person Plan&quot; announced last time? (Did you miss it? See page 32 of the Jan-Feb issue.) Nothing much has happened. We are still trying to resolve the computer requirements of this anticipated &quot;Ripple Effect&quot; plan. In that issue we said, &quot;We have an absolutely tremendous plan: we want to do this entirely by word-of-mouth, which worked so well for us before. But the new wrinkle is that the &quot;ripple plan&quot; consists of providing people who pass on the vision the reward of knowing month by month how many others are touched by their initiative. Wouldn&#39;t you keep passing things on if you had any idea of the ripples of distant influence your efforts produced?&quot; This kind of a computer program can make a marvelous contribution to almost any pass-on-able vision. If anyone would like to help design this, write, phone, or fax me at: 533 Hermosa St. So. Pasadena CA 91030, 818-799-8339, 213-682-2047, respectively. But there is still another reason for focusing on key individuals out in the grass roots. No organization I know does a really good job of harvesting the talent and part time of people at a distance. Note the next two questions: Why should we give special emphasis to the enlistment of people at the grass roots? They can give their part time: they don&#39;t need a salary or &quot;raise support&quot; as a full-time missionary would have to do. They already have loads of local contacts, including local church ties. They are psychologically nearer to the people on our mailing list. This means people contacted by them will take more notice. It is easier to reach out to people who are local than to total strangers across the country (as our staff in Pasadena would have to do). They are located specifically in all the places where we wish to mobilize! There is no limitation to their number. Such people are a virtually inexhaustible resource in time, energy and creativity. What are the basic essentials in any strategy to harvest part time workers at a distance? Most of them will need someone to &quot;pace&quot; and appreciate their efforts--a vital contact not less than weekly. They need to be able to see the results of their efforts in fairly short term. The more effective this is, the less important #1 is. They will benefit and flourish best if they have some sense of fellowship with others elsewhere who are trying to do the same thing (or things). They are not consumers but salespeople. What they sell they must believe in, but it is not how much they buy into but how much they can sell to others that counts. They ought to be able to see a reproduction of their efforts in those whose lives they touch. They would seem greatly to profit from knowledge of the &quot;ripple effect&quot; of what they do, in case any of their efforts affect people out of range of their immediately environment. In this sense there can be two kinds of workers: those whose labors are focused on people locally, and those whose labors are focused on creating a chain reaction affecting people they know at a distance, the latter becoming sources of ripples of influence further on. What has happened so far with your new approach to funding and extending the circulation of this Mission Frontiers bulletin? Our detailed study of this question (presented last time, page 5) has not brought a lot of response! We basically said that it is a waste of the Lord&#39;s money for lots of little gifts to be handled. (It would run into hundreds of thousands of dollars just to process that many letters). The most economical and practical way for this bulletin to be funded is for one gift of $136.50 to come once a year from every locality in which there are 70 who get this bulletin. Rick Wood, managing editor, said his church&#39;s mission committee chairman sat down and wrote a $136.50 check and sent it in. As the circulation expands, this kind of gift will remain the same for each new group of 70 recipients. We have presented other alternatives. We have not received a whole lot of other suggestions. A perceptive reader might ask, &quot;Why are you willing to put up with (small) $15 gifts but not subscription-size checks? In looking for $136.50 payments for 70 people for a year (for Mission Frontiers) we are dealing with old friends that really believe in what we are doing. We are asking their help. In looking for $15 gifts from completely new, unsure people, we are willing to do anything to help them step over the line and begin to drink in the vision. We cannot ask new people to take big steps. We think we can ask old people to do so. This bulletin is not very fancy, or very expensive, but the vision and news it contains has over the years transformed the lives of many believers--for whom the global work of God had been either non- existent or, according to reports, a small and failing force. It seems to us very important for each local group of 70 people who receive this bulletin to reach out to each other in some way for mutual blessing and mobilizing activity--we must work the works of Him that sent us, while it is day. The night comes when no man can work. In closing, friends, please let me ask you to pray for our workers in Pasadena and regional offices.

    "content": "AD2000 Handbook 1993 Version Luis Bush Purpose In a spirit of servanthood, the AD 2000 &amp; Beyond Movement seeks to encourage, motivate and network men and women church leaders by inspiring them with the vision of reaching the unreached by the year 2000 through consultations, prayer efforts and written materials. The intention is to encourage cooperation among existing churches, movements and structures to work together towards this same vision. The expected result is the establishment of a mission-minded church planting movement within every unreached and unevangelized people and city by AD 2000 so that all peoples might have a valid opportunity to experience the love, truth and saving power of Jesus Christ in fellowship with other believers. Rationale How did it begin? &quot;A church for every people and the gospel for every person by AD 2000&quot; has become the rallying cry of the AD 2000 &amp; Beyond Movement. By July 1990, researchers reported more than 2000 evangelization plans focused on the year 2000 and the number is increasing weekly. The perception of AD 2000 as a magnetic target has grown over the past twenty years, but only in recent years has it become a primary focus of many in the church. One-third of these programs are from the Two Thirds world. This is truly a global evangelization movement. Although most of these plans operate independently of each other, there is a felt need among these leaders for greater mutual awareness of their efforts to mobilize the worldwide body of Christ for world evangelization by AD 2000. Furthermore, as we approach the year 2000, many national leaders are developing their own AD 2000 country strategies. Never has the need been greater to see the worldwide body of Christ coordinate its efforts for world evangelization. Why the Year 2000? As Christians approach the end of this century, many groups within the worldwide body of Christ are seeing the year 2000 as a symbolic milestone for humankind. This has been true for years, but only recently has this phenomena come to the forefront, due to various writings, relationships and consultations. Because of the significance of the year 2000, this movement emphasizes the importance of calling the church to world evangelization both as we approach and as we enter the 21st century. Although no eschatological importance is attached to the year 2000, this milestone is intended to serve both as a focal point for evangelization plans and a transition time into a new century of world evangelization. The AD 2000 &amp; Beyond Movement grows out of a desire to respond both to the imperative of Scripture and the Great Commission mandate of our Lord Jesus Christ, and to the unique opportunity to mobilize all of God&#39;s people to reach the unreached by the year 2000, as God&#39;s people everywhere establish unprecedented faith goals to the year 2000. What is the Purpose of the AD 2000 &amp; Beyond Movement? In a spirit of servanthood the people involved in the AD 2000 &amp; Beyond Movement seek to encourage, motivate and network men and women church leaders by inspiring them with the vision of reaching the unreached by AD 2000 through consultations, prayer efforts and written materials. The intention is to encourage cooperation among existing churches, movements and structures to work together toward this vision. The expected result is the establishment of a mission-minded church planting movement within every unreached and unevangelized people and city by AD 2000 so that all peoples might have a valid opportunity to experience the love, truth and saving power of Jesus Christ in fellowship with other believers. The understanding of terms in the purpose statement is based upon the definitions and facts presented at the Lausanne II Congress in Manila in July 1989 in the Manila Manifesto under the heading 11, titled, &quot;The Challenge of AD 2000 and Beyond.&quot; The term &quot;unreached&quot; refers to those approximately two billion people who are not within reach of Christians of their own people and do not yet have a vital, indigenous church movement. The term &quot;people&quot; refers to the larger ethno-linguistic groups, estimated to be 2000 among which there are an estimated 12,000 smaller peoples. What is the nature and role of the AD 2000 &amp; Beyond Movement? The AD 2000 &amp; Beyond Movement refers to the registered organizational unit seeking to add catalytic impetus to the various movements of the world that make up a global movement of the Holy Spirit. Through a survey done in preparation for GCOWE, held in Singapore in 1989, in which 1100 people participated from sixty countries, it became clear that the greatest obstacle to world evangelization by the year 2000 is lack of vision. Thus, according to this survey the greatest single factor contributing to the fulfillment of the Great Commission is the development and sharing of vision. The AD 2000 &amp; Beyond Movement shares the vision and communicates what the Holy Spirit is doing through the body of Christ throughout the world. The two key verbs are &quot;motivate&quot; and &quot;network&quot;. The two main avenues of sharing the vision are through &quot;national consultations&quot; and &quot;common interest groups.&quot; The scope of the vision is to see an AD 2000 spiritual initiative in 200 countries around the world. The primary focus of the vision is the resistant belt between ten to forty degrees north of the equator from West Africa to East Asia, called the 10/40 Window, where the vast majority of unreached are located. Several words summarize the common commitment of many people involved in the national and global initiatives related to the AD 2000 &amp; Beyond Movement. The first word is &quot;mobilization&quot;, referring to the awakening of the church in every country of the world to find their place in the task of national and world evangelization. The second is &quot;empowerment&quot; which underscores the fact that the Lord has provided not only technological tools but mainly his own Spirit, to empower his people in the task of evangelization. The third is &quot;penetration&quot; which suggests the targeting of spiritual ministry primarily on the unfinished task of planting the church where there is none and proclaiming the gospel to every person. The fourth word is &quot;compassion&quot; which reflects the concern for the whole person and the need to minister as servants. The fifth is &quot;collaboration&quot; which expresses the need to network and to work together to share Christ&#39;s love. The sixth, &quot;intensification,&quot; underscores the urgency of the hour as we move to the milestone date, AD 2000. The seventh is &quot;fulfillment.&quot; It expresses the conviction that, yes, it is possible to bring the gospel to all people by the year 2000. Dr. Bong Rin Ro, general secretary of the World Evangelical Fellowship Theological Commission and coordinator of the theological issues track, emphasized that AD 2000 is a &quot;grass-roots networking structure.&quot; Dr. Bill Taylor, general secretary of the WEF Missions Commission, calls it a &quot;grass-roots movement, a network of networks, a fusion of visions.&quot; Dr. Peter Wagner, professor at Fuller Seminary School of World Missions notes: &quot;We are all controlled from the bottom up rather than from the top down.&quot; Phill Butler of Interdev observes that the AD 2000 &amp; Beyond Movement has a &quot;...focus on catalyzing, mobilizing, multiplying resources, thru networks.&quot; The intention of the movement, as stated in the general purpose statement, is to &quot;encourage cooperation among existing churches, movements, and structures to work together toward this vision.&quot; Why is the 10/40 Window a primary focus? The strongest focus of the AD 2000 &amp; Beyond Movement is on the 10/40 Window, the termed coined for the area of the world between 10 degrees and 40 degrees North latitude, which stretches from North Africa and southern Spain to Japan and northern Philippines. This is not to say that AD 2000 &amp; Beyond Movement is unconcerned about the rest of the world. Its ultimate vision is that none should perish in any part of the world. However, there are compelling reasons why committed Christians need to focus on the Window. The first is because of the historical and biblical significance of this part of the world. The entire account of the Old Testament deals with lands inside this area. Secondly, most of the least evangelized people and countries of the world are here. In fact, 97% of the people living in the fifty five least evangelical countries are in the 10/40 Window. A third reason Christians need to focus on the Window is because this is where the three main religious blocks, Islam, Hinduism and Buddhism, are located. Adherents to the Islamic religion are growing. Yet it is reported that many Moslems who, having studied the Koran in great depth, have discovered that the highest prophet described in the Koran is Jesus Christ and not Mohammed. We must pray that the eyes and the hearts of the Moslems will be opened to recognize that the Christ of the Koran is the Son of God, who died for the sins of mankind and rose again for our salvation. The Muslim block makes up 22% of the 3.14 million people living in the Window, the Hindu block comprises 23% of this area&#39;s population, and the Buddhist block totals 5%. A fourth reason to focus our attention on the 10/40 Window is because the poor are there. There is a remarkable overlap between the fifty poorest countries of the world and the least evangelized countries of the world. In fact, 79% of the people who are poorest are also among the least evangelized. And when you relate them to the 10/40 Window, you discover that 99% of these least evangelized poor —2.3 billion people—live in the 10/40 Window. Only 6% of the missionary force now works among this 44% of the world&#39;s population. This certainly makes up the greatest challenge of this decade for the committed Christian! The fifth reason to focus on the 10/40 Window relates to &quot;quality of life&quot;. One way of measuring the quality of life is to combine three variables: life expectancy, infant mortality, and literacy. When the world&#39;s fifty countries with the lowest quality of life are identified and mapped, the overlap with the countries in the 10/40 Window is evident. A sixth reason to focus on the 10/40 Window is because it is a stronghold of Satan. As the Christian presence has expanded around the world, it appears that those people living in the 10/40 Window have suffered not only hunger and a low quality of life compared to the rest of humanity, but have also been kept from the transforming, life giving, community changing power of the Gospel. Evidently Satan has established a territorial stronghold with his forces to restrain the advance of the Gospel in this area. If we are to advance into this territory in a significant way, we will need to put on the full armor of God, secure our borders, and fight with the weapons described by the Apostle Paul in 2 Cor. 10:3: &quot;For though we live in the world, we do not wage war as the world does. The weapons we fight with are not weapons of the world. On the contrary, they have divine power to demolish strongholds.&quot; Work going on in other places of the world is certainly important, and should not be curtailed. Rather, we need to increase our efforts to reach those who live in the Window. If we are to be faithful to Scripture and obedient to the mandate of Christ to see a mission-minded church planting movement established within every unreached people, so that all peoples might have a valid opportunity to experience the love, truth, and saving power of Jesus Christ, we must get to the core of the unreached: The 10/40 Window. The Poor, The Least Evangelized &amp; The 10/40 Window 99% of the least evangelized poorest of the poor are here. Download PDF for the full article: AD2000-Handbook-1993-Version.pdf",

    "content": "How Can All Peoples Be Reached By The Year 2000? Luis Bush An Address to the ISFM, Kansas City, Missouri Sept 17-19, 1992 This year we celebrate the bicentenary of William Carey who is known as the father of modern day missions. Carey arrived in India in 1792. One hundred years later A.T. Pierson made the statement: &quot;At this centenary of William Carey; God&#39;s signals flash like lightning and boom like thunder around the sky. By every mightiest argument and most persuasive appeal; by every motive drawn from a world&#39;s need and our opportunity; by every open door and loud cry; by every Scripture prophecy and promise, and by every unfolding of Providence, Christ is just now saying to His Church, &#39;Go ye into all the world, and preach the Gospel to every creature.&#39;&quot;At the bicentenary of William Carey we can readily say &quot;A Church for Every People and the Gospel for Every Person by the Year 2000.&quot; And borrowing from D.L. Moody--who believed the world could be evangelized by the year 1900--we might add, &quot;it can be done, it ought to be done, it must be done.&quot; African Example Perhaps, this has never been quite so clear to me as when standing one month ago amidst more than 12,000 black African ministers of the gospel from more than 2150 African denominations and forty five countries. With hands raised toward heaven they were all praying aloud together as William Kumuyi was being commissioned as regional coordinator of AD 2000 for Africa. Kumuyi is pastor of the largest church in Africa, with missionaries in 35 countries and many languages of Africa, and meetings in 600 districts in Lagos. Minutes before, the Africa 2000 Declaration had been signed personally by more than 10,100 ministers. This was a moment of dedication--not only for William Kumuyi--but for each one of them to the task that they had set for themselves as they declared: We meet in the recognition of our historical background of civil wars and tribal strife but we join together as one body in Christ, standing on the promises of the Word of God and believing that God loves Africa and wants to use Africa for his glory. While poverty and starvation and AIDS threaten many across the land we know that the Church is the pathway to peace and prosperity and is the salt of the earth. We acknowledge that the enormous and diverse problems we face in society in Africa are due in part because the church has not taken up its role as the salt of the earth and the light of the world. Further, we have been so taken up with our own problems that we have not looked upon the spiritual needs of the African countries in North Africa and other parts of the world. We repent and humbly confess our sins of omission and commission as a church, as well as the collective sins of the countries that we represent from all of Africa. We thank God for the missionaries who have come, beginning with Robert Moffat, a little less than 180 years ago and for the advance of the gospel in Africa and the size, the scope and the commitment of this generation&#39;s African church. We recognize that we have sometimes struggled with our missionary friends from overseas. We regret that they did not train and prepare us for cross-cultural missions. We also recognize that we have experienced division between denominations. For this disunity we repent before Almighty God. We acknowledge the work of the Holy Spirit in adding to the church those who are being saved in the continent of Africa such that there has been a remarkable growth of the church during this century. We also acknowledge the emergence of new forms of biblical Christianity from the African soil. We consider that we are living in a singular moment in the history of the church as we move toward the year 2000 and believe that God has graciously opened a window of opportunity for reaching all of Africa by the year 2000 and also participating together with Christians from other cultures in seeing a church for every people and the gospel for every person in the world by the year 2000. Furthermore, we acknowledge the biblical, historical and current day importance of intercessory prayer as a primary strategy for fulfilling the Great Commission. For the complete text of the seven resolutions following these seven declarations, see page 11. As we observe the remarkable spiritual initiative of the church in the two-thirds world today, as this movement in Africa suggests, we can be both encouraged and expectant that the obstacles can be overcome so that there will be a church for every people and the gospel for every person by the year 2000. &quot;The supreme question of the hour for the Christian,&quot; said A.T. Pierson 100 years ago, &quot;is the evangelization of the world by the end of the century.&quot; Today it again is the supreme question of the hour for the Christian. In fact, we have much to rejoice about when we compare the state of Christianity with that of Carey&#39;s day. In his Enquiry Into the Obligation of Christians to Use Means for the Conversion of the Heathen, Carey estimated that fewer than one-third of the countries of the world had any gospel witness. Today we are not only talking about every country but also every ethno-linguistic people group in every country of the world. The question before us at this consultation is: What will it take so that all peoples be reached by AD 2000? I. For all peoples to be reached by the year 2000, the biblical priority needs to be affirmed in the mission agencies and among the local churches around the world. A. Explanation: The highest priority in missions today is not only cross-cultural evangelism but cross-cultural evangelism to the unreached. Let me repeat that. The highest priority in missions today is not only cross- cultural evangelism but cross-cultural evangelism to the unreached. Today&#39;s biggest challenge is to reach the unreached. The single most important task is to see that a viable indigenous church be established within each ethno-linguistic group of people. B. Biblical Evidence: &quot;A world having turned from God,&quot; Graham Scroggie wrote in his book The Drama of World Redemption, &quot;He left it and chose a Man through whom He would ultimately by Christ reach the lost.&quot; That man was Abraham. The first major act of God following the formation of the different ethno-linguistic peoples and the scattering of the human families of the earth by language groups was the divinely initiated missions mandate for blessing to be experienced among each of these families. The Call of Abraham in Genesis 12 was with the promise of being a blessing to all the families of the earth. As the father of God&#39;s people--including Israel and all who believed--you and I as believers were in Abraham and called to be a blessing. Dr. Bruce Waltke, who co-authored the Theological Wordbook of the Old Testament, assured me that from his perspective both the Old Testament and the New Testament missions mandate have an ethno- linguistic people group focus. Jesus instructed his followers to disciple panta ta ethne, all the nations, all the ethno-linguistic or people groups. In Matthew 24, the disciples ask Jesus how to recognize the time of His coming and the end of the age. Jesus described to them some of the signs of the end time. He said there would be noise of battles, famines, earthquakes as well as strong persecution among those who follow Him. But then Jesus becomes more specific concerning His return when He says in verse 14, &quot;And this good news about the kingdom will be preached in all the world as a testimony to all peoples and then the end will come.&quot; You can trace the thread of the concept of nations or people groups through the Scriptures all the way to Revelation, the last book in the Bible. They will be there from all languages and peoples. God&#39;s eternal concern for the unreached peoples is clearly expressed in: Rev. 7:9 After this I looked and there before me was a great multitude that no one could count, from every nation, tribe, people and language, standing before the throne and in front of the Lamb. They were wearing white robes and were holding palm branches in their hands. Rev. 5:9 And they sang a new song: &quot;You are worthy to take the scroll and to open its seals, because you were slain, and with your blood you purchased men for God from every tribe and language and people and nation.&quot; These unreached peoples have been called by such different labels as hidden peoples, frontier peoples, by-passed peoples, unpenetrated peoples, or unreached peoples, but they represent the target peoples in God&#39;s plan. II. For all peoples to be reached by the year 2000, the reasons for progress towards the goal need to be understood and the do-ability of the task affirmed. In a survey of Christian leaders around the world, in preparation for the upcoming Global Consultation on World Evangelization by the Year 2000 and Beyond, the question was asked, &quot;How do you know that the world has been reached?&quot; The vast majority of the 1100 respondents from 60 countries said &quot;a viable church among every unreached people group in the world.&quot; There is a growing conviction of the do-ability of the task. Never in the history of the church has the completion of the Great Commission been as feasible as it is today. The number of Great Commission Christians is proportionately higher than ever, and the church is more international than ever, the resources available to us are greater than ever, and our understanding of the task before us is clearer than ever. We no longer talk of 2.4 billion unreached individuals, we now talk of a few thousand unreached people groups. When Donald McGavran reviewed the responsiveness of the people movements in the Punjab with Fred and Margaret Stock, who wrote the book by that name, he developed the need to focus on people groups in his book The Bridges of God. Simultaneously in Guatemala, Cameron Townsend was confronted by the Indian who said, &quot;If your God is so great why can&#39;t he speak my language?&quot; Consequently, Wycliffe Bible Translators was started to translate the Word of God in the language of each people. A watershed in the concept of unreached people groups was at Lausanne I in 1974 when Ralph Winter spoke on the subject of cross-cultural evangelism. Very casually he said &quot;...there are still 2.4 billion people beyond the range of present efforts of any existing church or mission.&quot; At the closing session of the 1974 gathering--which Time Magazine called the most formidable forum of Christians ever to gather together--Billy Graham picked up on Ralph&#39;s concern when he said, &quot;It is not enough that we witness to our near neighbors, we must cross cultural and linguistic barriers with the Gospel.&quot; All these years the U.S. Center for World Mission has maintained a consistent focus on the unreached peoples, which has significantly influenced the way we look at missions. In his capacity as Chairman of the Strategy Working Group of Lausanne and Director of MARC of World Vision, Ed Dayton continued a strong emphasis on the unreached peoples, incorporating practical strategies in the book Planning Strategies for World Evangelization. David Barrett has contributed significantly with his strong emphasis on the unreached peoples and the least evangelized world. John Robb has traveled extensively throughout the world--giving seminars on unreached peoples. Frank Kaleb Jansen has poured his heart into the Unreached Peoples Map, and so many others have made enormous contributions. Jack Frizen is finishing up 28 years as the Executive Director of IFMA--an association of North American mission agencies. When he was asked to identify the most significant trend in missions during the last twenty years for the Evangelical Missions Quarterly on its twentieth anniversary, he answered, &quot;My choice is the renewed focus on unreached people groups and penetrating the frontiers still remaining.&quot; There has been some shift within mission agencies to allot more personnel to unreached areas, while at the same time there have been new agencies formed with a major focus on reaching the unreached. In their longest article ever devoted to the missionary effort, with a pioneer missionary on the cover, TIME Magazine wrote, &quot;The most important change in Protestant missionary strategy in the past ten years has been to identify and seek to contact some 16,000 tribes and social groups around the world that have been beyond the reach of the Gospel.&quot; The Adopt-a-People Clearinghouse was established in March 1989 on the campus of William Carey International University in a gathering of leaders of 48 mission agencies who recognized the need for an independent clearinghouse that would have an exclusive focus on the unreached peoples. The Adopt-A-People Clearinghouse has continued to grow to 75 agencies today. Its commission is threefold: 1) to compile a global database of unreached peoples to track which peoples are unreached, 2) to collect and compile profiles on these peoples and 3) to act as a &quot;marketing agent&quot; on behalf of mission agencies for the unreached peoples. After two years a list has been compiled of unreached peoples, clusters and ethno-linguistic blocs, as have other lists including a list of two thousand least evangelized peoples by David Barrett and Todd Johnson with Patrick Johnstone. Both Patrick Johnstone and Kaleb Jansen reckon that a high percentage of the larger blocs listed have significant church planting efforts among them. Kaleb suggests that this is as high 80%. We are beginning to have visibility within these groups of the church planting work that is being done among them. The growth of two thirds world missions to some 50,000 cross-cultural missionaries today, with expectation of that number more than doubling by the year 2000 at the present rate of growth, is full of promise. Agreement by many on a basic understanding of what an unreached people group is resulted from the work of a sizeable and representative group of people in 1982 who defined the concept of an unreached people group in these words, &quot;A people group among which there is no indigenous community of believing Christians with adequate numbers and resources to evangelize this people group without outside (cross-cultural) assistance.&quot; All kinds of partnerships, cooperative ventures and alliances are taking shape around the world. As a result of an AD 2000 meeting held in May in Riga, Latvia, at which the declaration commitment of the more than 800 Christians from 14 republics of the former USSR was to see the 138 ethno-linguistic people groups of that area reached by the year 2000. At that meeting an alliance of church planting mission agencies was formed. As of last week twenty agencies had joined, with a commitment of sending 300 long term missionaries in the next three years and supporting 500 national missionaries. A report from Wycliffe suggests that there are already believers among each of the 138 ethno-linguistic groups in the former USSR. Major national initiatives toward the year 2000 are taking place around the world. In at least 100 countries of the world today there are spiritual initiatives of Christian leaders in those countries toward the evangelization of their countries by the year 2000 and beyond. Even in a country like Bangladesh, with its great needs, the initiative of the Garos tribe alone has resulted in a church among all of the 20 indigenous unreached tribal peoples of Bangaldesh. The Garos are today almost 100% Christian, and I will never forget their commitment at the 100 year celebration, &quot;A church among each of the peoples of Bangaldesh by the year 2000.&quot; And they are doing it. But for all the focus, growing conviction and momentum of the do- ability of the task, we still face enormous obstacles as we seek to complete the task by the year 2000. III. For all peoples to be reached by the year 2000, we need to understand and face the obstacles to be overcome. A disproportionately low percentage of the personnel and financial resources of the body of Christ are being channelled for frontier missions. In fact when you get to the core of the core of those who are both spiritually and materially the poorest of the poor, you find that 2.3 Billion people in 19 countries receive only 6% of the missionary force. David Barrett has suggested that we give special attention to 3,030 segments. &quot;These 3,030 segments make up one quarter of the world&#39;s population. They involve some 2,000 peoples, 1,000 urban centers and 30 countries. Less than .01% of the total mission force is working among this group. They receive about 1,000 missionaries, .1% of all Christian literature, .01% of all Christian TV, and less than .01% of every missionary dollar.&quot; (Why? One reason is that while we have the information and facts about these segments, we have not adequately communicated them to local churches and mission agencies.) Mission agencies and local churches are still not clear on the facts, nor the implications of those facts. In responding to the draft list of 6000 unreached peoples or adoptable peoples published by the Adopt-a-People Clearinghouse, the General Director of one of large denominationally-based mission wrote, &quot;We are working among 25 to 40 unreached people groups around the world. I say, &#39;25 to 40&#39; because one never quite knows if a certain group is classified as &#39;unreached&#39; or not.&quot; In my opinion this comment is more a reflection on the researchers and missiologists who have been establishing parameters than on the local church or mission agency. While some churches have responded to the challenge, many have not. David Smith, U.S. Director of Mobilization for WEC International, with its long record of missions to unreached peoples, wrote the following response to the list of 6000 unreached groups in a letter dated August 26, 1992, &quot;We are somewhat curious. In the years we have been involved, we have communicated with every church that has shown interest. We have aggressively communicated with them. We have had five that have really adopted… I hope other missions are having more success.&quot; Since 1989 only eleven churches have adopted unreached people groups through the Adopt-A-People Clearinghouse. In fact, the Adopt-A-People Clearinghouse is aware of only 100 unreached peoples that have been adopted in all these years. We who are in the data collection, analysis and dissemination process have sometimes confused those we wish to mobilize by the variety of models we have proposed for understanding the state of Christianity. For example, one researcher has given technical meanings to terms such as &quot;Christian&quot; and &quot;evangelized&quot; that run counter to the intuition of most practitioners. David Hesselgrave, head of the Evangelical Mission Society, has noted that these terms are &quot;up for grabs.&quot; As Pete Holzmann has researched this issue extensively in recent months, he notes that there appear to be two areas of misunderstanding and disagreement among various parties. He observes, &quot;We can live with disagreement, as long as we understand each other and treat each other with the love and respect God requires of us.&quot; The two major areas of focus are: 1)What is the proper meaning of exposure to the Gospel, and how is it measured? and 2)What is the proper meaning of response to the Gospel, and how is it measured? David Barrett has done us all a service by trying to quantify the level of exposure to the gospel that has been given to various segments of our world. Measuring Response What about measuring response to the gospel? This relates directly to our subject of reaching the unreached peoples. We can all think of some people groups that need no cross-cultural assistance to evangelize their own people and thus are clearly reached. We also know other people groups that just as clearly require cross-cultural assistance and thus are unreached. And we all know yet other groups for which the need for cross-cultural assistance is uncertain and thus we find them difficult to classify. Billy Graham has stated that it takes 5% effort to win a person to Christ and 95% effort to ground that person in his faith in Christ. We need to be careful that in our zeal to get to the clearly unreached people groups we don&#39;t abort God&#39;s purposes for those groups which have a good start but still require cross-cultural assistance. The sheer number of people that call themselves Christian in a given people group can give a clue to whether a group is reached or not, but is by no means determinative. Dr. Paul Kauffman is an early Pentecostal missionary and the originator of the very fine periodical Asian Outreach. He has developed one of the best and most succinct answers to the question of &quot;When is a people group reached?&quot; It is reached when the believers in that group have been sufficiently grounded in the Word of God that they can be identified as disciples of Jesus Christ, who will then begin to multiply themselves in their own people group and then into other groups--in obedience to Christ&#39;s commands. Friends of the International Society for Frontier Missiology, here are some suggestions: We must repent from all that has hindered the advance of the gospel to the unreached. We must state clearly the definitions we are using to have a standard of accountabiltiy. We must communicate with clarity in a user- friendly way to bring the light of understanding to the unfinished task. We must understand the differences between our own theological and statistical bases in order to understand where it is that we can work in unity and where we work on separate paths. We must all give a clarion call. It would be sad to be left out of the greatest harvest of all time, of the reaching of the unreached peoples, of penetrating the last vestiges of enemy stronghold on peoples, as the kingdoms of this world are becoming the kingdoms of our God and His Christ. IV. For all peoples to be reached by the year 2000 we must take the steps necessary for the goal to be reached. Ed Dayton, who worked with David Frazer, wrote an outstanding book, Planning Strategies for World Evangelization, which focused primarily on the task of reaching all peoples, recorded from an &#39;82 meeting a seven step or stage process to accomplish this goal for any one unreached people group. For all the unreached people groups to be reached, these steps need to be taken and applied to all the unreached people groups. In discussion with Kaleb Jansen, Director of Adopt-a-People Clearinghouse, we have made some slight modifications to the phases. Stage 1 -- &quot;Reported&quot; A people group needs to be reported as unreached. Some mission agency or person needs to report that a specific group needs cross-sultural assistance. Minimally this includes a description of the locations where this group can be found, the names it is known by, the sizes reported for it and the languages in which the people communicate with one another and the outside world, including, for example, the trade language, the native language and the school language. Currently there are several lists circulating on the unreached. We need a target list for AD 2000 purposes to enlist prayer, to promote deployment of missionaries and the channeling of other resources, and to monitor progress toward the goal. &quot;Why do people want a list of peoples?&quot; you might ask. &quot;God already has a register of the peoples (Psalm 87:6), but we don&#39;t know where the group boundaries really are until we run into them, and we won&#39;t know exactly how many boundaries there are until we have crossed all of them.&quot; This may be true, but we need to start somewhere. Certainly, any list will be dynamic and changing as new groups are discovered and other groups are recognized to be extinct or reached. A single penetration will not necessarily be adequate to reach all the individuals within most of the megapeoples for which we have names. Yet certainly all the people groups within a megapeople will be brought closer by the penetration of one of the groups among them. Mexico Case Study Ron Rowland of Wycliffe has reviewed the response from the field in Mexico. Of the 270 people groups listed in Mexico, Ron offered the following encouraging comments after response from the field in Mexico and some Ethnologue checking: There may be up to five possibly unreached peoples which were not included in the list and which will require further checking. However very few of those which were listed come under the category of &quot;unreached.&quot; Nine of these are non- indigenous groups that will require special strategies such as the Afro-Seminole Creoles, the Chinese, German Jews, Japanese, etc. Ten of the indigenous language groups are &quot;unreached,&quot; and one unidentified; all are under 8000 in number. In addition Ron notes that all are in a language family where there are Christians in related languages who could evangelize them. The list of unreached peoples for Mexico, on the basis of the work done by Wycliffe, could be reduced from the 270 currently listed to just 18 or 19, with the others listed in another category. Ron Rowland discovered in his review of the list sent out by the Adopt-A-People Clearinghouse of 6000 macropeoples, megapeoples and people groups, that all the groups still considered unreached in Mexico are in language families accessible to Christians currently speaking some related language. Following, its development in 1989 from a broad-based coalition of mission agencies the Adopt-A-People Clearinghouse began the work of compiling a global data base of the unreached. For the first step on reporting, there were two parameters that were sought, name and location. These were inputted into the computer one by one by one. Mission agencies participated and sent in the names of the unreached peoples they were working among or had identified on the field. Twenty-three hundred of the 6000 names of peoples currently on the list were gathered this way. The remaining 3700 came from research done by individuals primarily from the Adopt-A-People Clearinghouse. Stage 2 -- &quot;Evaluated&quot; The reported group needs to be verified by a reliable source. Several important items should be assessed at this time: 1) The existence of the group 2) the classification of the group as a macropeople, megapeople or people group 3) four key elements reported: primary or representative locations, common names, varying estimates of size and the languages they are known to use 4) the religion and/or belief system 5) is there a multiplication of churches? 6) is there an indigenous trained leadership capable of leading the group? 7) are there adequate resources to reach their own group such as the Word of God in their language and available, etc.? 8) Do they have a missionary movement reaching out from their midst? On June 8 a preliminary list of 6000 names of macropeoples, megapeoples and people groups was published by Adopt-a-People. Stage 3 -- &quot;Preparation for Adoption&quot; Adequate research must be completed to permit interested Christians outside this group to make a decision to reach it. The listing of 6000 published by the Adopt-A- People Clearinghouse was sent out in conjunction with the the Unreached People Resource Track of the AD2000 &amp; Beyond Movement and MARC Publications. It was sent to the 75 participating mission agencies of the Clearinghouse. It was also sent to national research centers, committees and researchers in various countries around the world. A total of more than 200 packages were sent out around the world. The response to the list was interesting. Sometimes it created confusion. For instance, one General Director wrote back, &quot;I am still trying to figure out what it is you want me to do with the extensive material you sent on June 8 with a follow-up letter on August 19.&quot; To others it created frustration, &quot;We did try, but got totally frustrated in the process when we read the section on &#39;Reasons to Adopt.&#39;&quot; It also produced gratitude, &quot;A hearty word of thanks... to produce this composite list of unreached peoples. We are fully committed to work together with you on this. It&#39;s badly needed.&quot; Others have put in significant energy and personnel into the review and validation process, such as Wycliffe Bible Translators. Wycliffe sent out the listing of people groups to each of the fields by country and have received responses from twelve countries so far, including Mexico, Peru, and Nigeria. National researchers and research teams offered their input. In fact, the Church Growth Research Center in Madras, India went through each of the columns for each of the 1765 people groups on the list of 34 pages, thus partially validating the list. Others were also prompted into action. India Case Study Bob Waymire, of Light International, is one researcher who was prompted into action by the distribution of the list. His review of the India portion of the list builds on a 10 year history of working with a variety of organizations in India--including the India Missions Association--towards establishing effective information gathering, managing, and application techniques and structures. India is probably the most diverse country in the world when it comes to peoples and people groups. The difficulty in describing this broad mosaic is compounded by the caste system, the large number of languages and dialects, the tribes, and the varieties and strains of religions. India hosts almost one-quarter of the all of the 6000 unreached peoples listed by the Clearinghouse. Bob writes, &quot;Over the past decade considerable effort has been expended in determination to effectively describe and status the people groups in support of evangelism and church-planting. Good progress is being made, and a methodical state-by-state survey is in progress coordinated by the National Socio-Cultural Survey Committee functioning under the auspices of the India Missions Association (IMA).&quot; As a result of the work on verification and validation of the list in India, the review by Wycliffe, and the work by Light International, three status reports concerning India have been assembled: A status report primarily on the ethno-linguistic blocs (approximately 365 entries). This contains up-to-date status reports on various aspects of the progress of the Gospel, including the number of Christians in each group. Missing is any definitive data on the number of churches/congregations. A case-study/status report on the state of Bihar which includes the latest data from the &quot;harvest field/harvest force&quot; survey just released. This identifies Scheduled Castes and Tribes, Muslim Groups, and Backward Castes. (Surveys are also near completion in Orissa and Andhra Pradesh states.) Basic people group status by state (approximately 1735 entries). The status applies to groups less than 2% Christian, and depicts status in 12 categories (reported, verified, heard, responded, translation, etc.). There is a group listing for each state with status provided by state. Although there are many duplications in group names, the status from state-to-state varies greatly. In most cases there are language variations by state also. It should be noted that much of the data are estimates accumulated from a wide variety of sources. Very little of the 1991 Census data is available about religions by state. An AD 2000 target list is expected to be available by December 31, 1992. Stage 4 -- &quot;Adopted&quot; The people group needs to be adopted. The Adopt- A-People Clearinghouse is planning an adoption process by assigning people groups to churches by zip code around the U.S. The U.S. is no longer alone in desiring to adopt and reach the unreached peoples. In Latin America, COMIBAM is sponsoring a meeting next month (Oct. 92) to consider national and continental strategies for the adoption of unreached peoples and to equip key Latin American researchers to coordinate the establishment of &quot;permanent national research functions&quot; in every country in Latin America. Costa Rica has taken major steps toward becoming a full partner in reaching the unreached peoples. They went through a process of determining that 50 people groups was their &quot;fair share&quot; as the church in Costa Rica, based on a proportionate approach to the number of evangelicals in the continent of Latin American and the number of unreached peoples in the world. The Latin American Federation of Evangelical Missions, FEDEMEC, representing over 30 denominations and Christian organizations, started in 1986 with a goal of establishing a church planting movement of disciples of Jesus Christ in at least 50 unreached people groups by sending 500 church planting missionaries by the year 2000. In February they reported that adoptions were already up to 100. A series of meetings with denominational leaders, involving prayer and research, has taken them through a pre-adoption process. At this point the pre-adopted peoples were presented to the national assemblies of the different denominations who assessed and approved adoptions which then took place at a subsequent national level meeting. They are engaged in exploratory trips, local church missions mobilization, missions training, and I fully expect that, at the current pace, they will meet their goals. Africa is seeking to send out 10,000 cross-cultural missionaries by the year 2000. There is a heavy burden among Africans for the people groups of North Africa. Prayer Increasing One of the most hopeful elements in the adoption process is the growing burden among God&#39;s people. Intercessory prayer by the local church for the unreached peoples at this stage will release enormous spiritual power and raise up workers for the harvest field. A significant global initiative, with enormous implications for reaching the unreached peoples by the year 2000, is a month of concerted prayer and fasting for mission outreach into the 10/40 window scheduled for next October (1993). Research indicates that more than 80% of the population of unreached people groups live within the 10/40 window. This is apparent whether you consider the 170 megapeoples listed by David Barrett and Todd Johnson, or the list of 72 peoples on the Unreached People Map published by Frank Kaleb Jansen. Over 10,000 African ministers are committed to enlisting the participation of 5 million Africans who will participate in this initiative of prayer and fasting, concluding with major prayer rallys at stadiums throughout Africa on the last Saturday of the month. Over 60,000 are scheduled for a simultaneous prayer rally in Osaka, Japan and will be praying &quot;through the window.&quot; Simple training materials are being prepared, along with a 31-day prayer guide for the month of October, 1993. These transferable materials will be funnelled through an estimated 150 prayer networks, denominations and parachurch ministries. Dick Eastman is the chairman of this initiative, called Praying Through the Window. He explains that &quot;Every Home for Christ already has contacted our 70 global offices, encouraging their involvement in helping alert EHC&#39;s estimated 250,000 global prayer partners. Jane Hansen, president of Women&#39;s Aglow International and vice-chairperson of Praying Through the Window, said, &quot;I am so excited to see the almost 500,000 women identified with Women&#39;s Aglow International in 2,500 chapters across 105 nations become involved with this bold campaign to focus prayer on the 10/40 Window.&quot; In Nicaragua, the President of the Alliance of Churches has expressed a commitment to mobilize 2000 churches in Nicaragua for this event. This month, in one of the largest churches in Mexico, an initial seminar is being held to prepare over 1,000 participants for participation in this October 1993 effort. This focus on the spiritually neediest part of the world will lead to prayer for the whole area and adoption of specific countries. The Adopt-A-People Clearinghouse will be providing unreached people materials to those praying for the whole 10/40 window and then in greater detail for those praying for the unreached peoples within each country. Stage 5 -- &quot;Church Planting&quot; Initial field work needs to begin with the intent of establishing an evangelizing culturally indigenous church. The question is whether there is anyone there working with church planting as the primary goal? Stage 6 -- &quot;Exposure&quot; We need to make the claims of Christ widely known among the target people group to the extent that we can be sure that the gospel has been adequately presented (50% of the people are being exposed). Here are some factors to consider in determining the extent to which a group has been &quot;exposed&quot;: radio broadcasts the Jesus film Christian literature distribution surveys to determine the extent of knowledge and understanding of the Christian message It is also essential to determine the extent to which the Word of God has been translated and the extent to which it is available to the individuals within the people group. Stage 7 -- &quot;Church Planting Movement&quot; This is the recognizable indicator that a group may no longer need cross-cultural assistance, and may be reached. Is there an evangelizing church? The group needs to have an indigenous community of believers with adequate numbers and resources to evangelize the remainder of the group with little or no outside (cross-cultural) assistance. Is there an adequate core of effectively trained church leadership? Without this, the movement cannot last. Stage 8 -- &quot;Cross-Cultural Mission Movement&quot; To return to Kauffman&#39;s grand summary, this is the true indicator that a group is really no longer unreached. Let us close by reviewing the steps for reaching the unreached: Reported, with identification its primary locations, names, sizes and languages. Evaluated for existence, classification, reported information, primary religions, existence of a multiplying church, indigenous trained leadership, existence and availability of the Word of God, and an indigenous missionary movement. Preparation for adoption through completion of a profile detailing the cultural and traveling distance to the closest church and the existence of churches and mission agencies targeting this group. Adopted by churches or mission agencies for focused prayer, information gathering and financial investment. Church Planting has been initiated as the primary goal of some outreach to them. Exposure of at least 50% of the population to the gospel through radio broadcasts, the Jesus film and the distribution of Christian literature. Credible surveys must be taken to verify the extent of understanding of the Christian message. In addition, the Word of God must be translated and available. A Church planting movement must be growing among the group, with competent indigenous leadership. A Cross-Cultural Mission Effort must be reaching out from within the group. Conclusion Thomas Wang, founder of the AD2000 Movement, has said, &quot;Sometimes when I close my eyes, it is as if I hear a bell ringing in heaven, and God says, &#39;Ladies and Gentlemen, time is up! You have been procrastinating long enough. It is time to finish the job.&#39;&quot; For all peoples to be reached by the year 2000 the biblical priority needs to be affirmed among mission agencies and local churches around the world. We must make this our top priority. We must realize that this is what God is waiting for. We must make ourselves fully available to Christ for His purpose. And we must be careful not be be sidetracked, but keep in view God&#39;s deepest passion: Reaching the Unreached!

    "title": "13,000 Meet in Lagos Nigeria for AD2000",
    "content": "13,000 Meet in Lagos Nigeria for AD2000 Peter Wagner The Largest Meeting of Pastors Ever! This is a personal account of a remarkable event--the Church Growth Conference for Africa held in the International Bible Training Center near Lagos, Nigeria, August 5-11, 1992. The figures were all but unbelievable. Some 13,000 pastors from 45 African nations, and representing 2,146 denominations, registered. In preparation, William Kumuyi, the host of the conference, had just completed the construction of his International Bible Training Center on the outskirts of Lagos. The meeting hall seats 15,000 with an impeccable state-of-the-art sound system. The two largest dormitories sleep 3,500 each. With a membership of 80,000 adults and 40,000 children it ranks as the world&#39;s third largest church. The focus of the conference was effective evangelism based on spiritual warfare and saturation church planting. As the days went by, the massive group developed ownership of the AD2000 vision and goals, including united prayer, the Day to Change the World, and the March for Jesus. By the final morning virtually all 13,000 were prepared to affix their signature to an &quot;Africa 2000 Declaration&quot; first drafted by Luis Bush and edited, not only by the leaders but amazingly, by an orderly evening plenary session of 13,000 chaired by William Kumuyi, the pastor of the Deeper Life Bible Church of Lagos, Nigeria. Before I left the USA for Nigeria, I had no reason to suspect that this event would be much different from scores of other pastor&#39;s conferences I have done over the years. Except, that is, for some very strong words from two or three of our prayer partners just as I was getting ready to go. They urged me to take extraordinary measures to build prayer support this time because God was preparing to do remarkable things during this conference. Neither I nor the intercessors had any idea of the details, but Doris and I followed their suggestions and activated all the rapid deployment prayer forces we were in touch with. The prophetic words of the intercessors were certainly validated. What started out as an ordinary church growth conference became the launching pad for the AD2000 Movement in Africa. The story behind this is rather remarkable. The Lord was working to bring leaders of various backgrounds together, even when it was uncomfortable. African Independent Churches Christian churches in Africa can roughly be divided into two groupings: mission churches and independent churches. The mission churches, as the name suggests, can trace their origin to Western mission agencies such as Anglicans, Baptists, Sudan Interior Mission, African Inland Mission, etc.. The independent churches have sprung up from the African soil with no ties to Western missions or churches. Kumuyi is pastor of an independent African church. I am not sure of the chronology, but certainly by the 1980s, and probably long before, African independent churches as a group were outgrowing the mission churches, and the differential continues to increase. At first these independent churches were viewed with suspicion by both western and African mission church leaders. Several scholars, led by British missiologist Harold Turner, studied this phenomenon in depth and concluded that it was a mistake to put them all into the same stereotype. Turner said the chief variable was whether they accepted the Bible as God&#39;s word. After discussion with my Fuller colleagues I concluded that Kumuyi&#39;s Deeper Life Bible Church was likely one of the more orthodox ones. I first met William Kumuyi at the 1989 Lausanne II meeting in Manila. It was there that I made a personal decision about Africa. I told Kumuyi that I wanted my first visit to West Africa to be with the Deeper Life Bible Church. He was happy with that, but suggested that if I came for a church growth conference we might get other churches to co-sponsor it. We particularly discussed the ECWA (Evangelcal Church of West Africa) which were numerous and had been birthed from SIM International. I sensed that God wanted me to take the risk and go with Kumuyi as host. Then God orchestrated a remarkable scenario. On the airplane from the Philippines to Nigeria William Kumuyi sat next to Panya Baba, currently president of ECWA. With myself as a mutual friend, the relationship between Baba and Kumuyi blossomed. They became deeply appreciative of and committed to each other. It took from 1989 to 1992 to sense the Lord&#39;s timing for the church growth conference we had agreed upon. In the interim the most significant new development in the worldwide church was the emergence of the AD2000 Movement. Luis Bush&#39;s invitation to to lead the AD2000 United Prayer Track brought about a radical change in our ministry. The nature of the AD2000 Movement makes it the most inclusive evangelistically-oriented agency ever to appear in Christendom. It accepts anyone as long as they are born again and have a desire to evangelize the world. One of the first things I did was to invite William Kumuyi to serve as African Regional Representative for the whole Prayer Track. This was a risk. I definitely did not want to anything to alienate the mission churches. A Greater Risk Then Luis Bush took an even greater risk. He invited Kumuyi to be the coordinator for the entire AD2000 Movement for the African continent. The last thing that Luis and I wanted to do would be to alienate mainline evangelicals represented by the AEAM (Association of Evangelicals of Africa and Madagascar) We knew about and depended strongly on the bridge which had been built between William Kumuyi and Panya Baba, a highly influential figure in AEAM. Then came a key person, Reuben Ezemandu, another Nigerian, the leader of the Association of African Mission Agencies, counterpart to IFMA. AEAM had set up an AD2000 Task Force and asked Ezemandu to chair it. This brought Ezemandu and Kumuyi together and through the mediation of Luis Bush they agreed to work closely together in AD2000. Ezemandu not only graciously agreed that Kumuyi should be the top African leader for the AD2000 Movement, but he also invited him to be the Executive Secretary of his AEAM AD2000 Task Force. What I have just described is one of the most remarkable developments in recent Third World church history. It could have been done only by God. No human planning could have designed it. This close cooperation made the conference a success. Conclusion This experience, more than any I can remember outside of Korea, says to the Christian world that this is a new day. When leadership like this rises up from the two-thirds world we can rest assured that the advance of the Kingdom of God does not depend on resources from the Western World alone, but that God has prepared a mighty army on all six continents for the final assault against the strongholds of the enemy. It gives great hope that the goal of AD2000--&quot;A Church For Every People And The Gospel For Every Person By AD2000&quot;--can and will be accomplished. (Dr. C. Peter Wagner is professor of Church Growth at Fuller Seminary&#39;s School of World Mission in Pasadena CA. and Chairman of the AD2000 Movement&#39;s United Prayer Track.) -- Africa 2000 Declaration August 11, 1992 Resolutions We therefore commit ourselves to boldly seize this crucial moment to cooperate with what the Holy Spirit is doing and with one another by seeking to call all the members of our churches and all biblically based churches throughout Africa to the glorious task before us. We commit ourselves to the goal of a church for every people and the gospel for every person in Africa by the year 2000. By this we mean that we will seek by any legitimate means possible, to make the gospel available to every African in a language they can understand by the year 2000. We will pray and work towards the goal of seeing Africa, south of the Sahara, predominantly Christian by the year 2000. In addition, we commit ourselves to establishing a church planting movement in every country and in every one of the hundreds of unreached people groups which have been by-passed and are separated by language and culture. Further, we commit ourselves to the goal of seeing Christ become incarnate in the life of a vital congregation in every city of every country in Africa by the year 2000. For this we commit ourselves to train and send 10,000 African missionaries cross- culturally by the year 2000 and to establish a strong missionary movement in every country of Africa. We commit ourselves to join with millions of Christians around the world in &quot;10/40 Focus 93&quot; (a month of massive prayer focused on the 10/40 Window) to prepare and then to pray with fasting including a total of some 5 million African intercessors during the entire month of October 1993 for spiritual breakthroughs, the bringing down of spiritual strongholds, the preparing of a harvest and the raising up of workers for all the countries, people groups, and cities in the 10/40 Window. On the last Saturday of October 1993 which is the 30th we will join with the example of our Japanese brothers and sisters who are planning a rally of 60,000 in a stadium in Osaka by organizing a final prayer rally in stadiums in cities across each country of Africa for the 10/40 Window. We commit ourselves to follow up the Africa 2000 conference held in Lagos with AD2000 country conferences in every one of the 54 countries of Africa from June 8-10 1993 in the same spirit and with the same principles, starting with a two-day seminar in February 1993 of national representatives/key leaders of various churches in each country to develop a national framework for action to plan activities and to set milestone objectives. On June 11 we will hold a whole day seminar to prepare for the 10/40 Focus &#39;93 in October. Then we will join together with millions of Christians around the world in every African country in Marches for Jesus on June 12, 1993. We commit ourselves to participate in the activities related to the Day to Change the World, June 25, 1995, with special emphasis on joining in the prayer with fasting for the 10/40 Window in the entire month of June and also join Christians around the world with a total of some five million African marchers in every capital city of every African country and 500 other cities in Africa with Marches for Jesus to praise God and to bring about a total well being of the city. Finally, recognizing the value of being networked with like-minded Christians from other countries around the world along interest and ministry lines we express our commitment to develop resource networks within our countries and to link up with the sixteen global tracks of the AD2000 &amp; Beyond Movement in the following interest areas: mobilization of united prayer, saturation church planting, unreached peoples and Bible translation, least evangelized cities, mobilization of national research, cross-cultural missionary raining, radio evangelism to the unreached, mobilization of women, mobilization of young people , spiritual mapping to understand and make known the spiritual battle ground we are fighting on, theological issues, mobilization of sports evangelism, creative access missions including tent-makers, the mobilization of the laity, and Bible distribution and literature evangelism.

    "title": "“Nations for Christ” Congress in the Former Soviet Union",
    "content": "“Nations for Christ” Congress in the Former Soviet Union Roberta Winter It was an incredible experience! For five days in Riga, Latvia 1000 delegates to the Nations for Christ Congress met daily in a showcase auditorium which two years ago was open only to communist gatherings. Many of those present had been in prison for their faith, some for years. Now, in a public building set in the middle of a busy public park, they were loudly singing the praises of Jesus Christ. And the published stated purpose of their gathering was to plant a church in every language, culture, town and village in the entire former USSR by the year 2000. Incredible! I was impressed by the joy of the people at the congress. On the streets of Riga, few people would look you in the eye and smile. But not so among these Christians! I was also impressed by the beautiful music. There must have been at least 7 different musical groups, each with its own unique style. One, a Christian Russian Jew, sang so loudly many of us on the front rows had to hold our hands over our ears, and I couldn&#39;t help but wonder if previously he would have been imprisoned for singing quietly. I have been to several international congresses on evangelism. Most of them were much larger than this one and were carefully planned years in advance. There wasn&#39;t time for the same kind of treatment here. Dr. Thomas Wang was the prime mover. He was formerly the International Director of the Lausanne Committee for World Evangelization and is now the International Chairman of the AD 2000 and Beyond Movement. In the fall of 1991 he made an extensive exploratory trip all over the former Soviet Union. In consultation with some of the pastors there and later with Luis Bush, former director of Partners International and now International Director of the AD 2000 Movement, they decided that now was the time to move forward in evangelizing all of the former Soviet Union. Since the AD 2000 and Beyond Movement stresses cooperation between agencies in everything they do, they invited several other agencies to help sponsor a kick-off conference which would be the beginning of a widespread saturation evangelism effort. David Howard of the World Evangelical Fellowship (WEF) was eager to participate as was World Team and World Gospel Mission, which loaned to the effort the president of their board, the Rev. Dwight Smith. They also contacted Jim Montgomery of DAWN (Discipling a Whole Nation) who loaned one of their mission with a great deal of experience in saturation evangelism techniques in several countries. Wolfgang Fernandez, a native of Venezuela and only 33 years of age, is a capable organizer and administrator. He did a fantastic job of pulling together this congress in just four months. Bringing in DAWN meant that this was not going to be just an international conference, as valuable as that was to these formerly persecuted Christians behind the iron curtain. Rather, this conference was designed to lay the capstone of an unprecedented, breath-taking plan to establish in every one of the new republics a follow-up pattern able to &quot;saturate&quot; the mind-boggling complex of sub- nations in an area that spans 11 time zones. In the Russian Federation alone (which had the most delegates to the congress) there are 31 &quot;autonomous&quot; republics. But when you add the ethnic subdivisions of the 15 free-standing republics which previously made up the USSR, you find 160 different ethnic units of major significance. The choice of name for the conference--The Nations for Christ-- reflected the special concern of both Thomas Wang and Luis Bush, for many of these &quot;nations&quot; (distinct ethnic groups within the former Soviet Union) are as yet almost completely unreached. Dr. Wang, born in China and perhaps the most widely known Christian leader from Asia, in 1980 had participated in the World Consultation on Frontier Missions in Edinburgh. It was unique in that it was a consultation of mission leaders only and stressed giving priority in evangelism to the unreached peoples of the world. Those who participated were already thinking ahead to the year 2000, as reflected in the slogan for that consultation: &quot;A Church for every people by the year 2000.&quot; In the intervening years since 1980, Dr. Wang was called to head up the Lausanne II conference in Manila. Though that conference brought together representatives from churches and mission agencies from around the world, Dr. Wang felt there still needed to be a second conference which emphasized the unreached peoples and gathered agency leaders together who were able to take concrete steps in reaching them. Thus, in the midst of the plans for Lausanne II, he called another smaller conference of mission agency leaders for the month of January in Singapore of 1989. Out of this second conference came the AD 2000 and Beyond Movement, using a revision of the slogan at Edinburgh II (as the 1980 consultation came to be called) which says, &quot;A church for every people, and the gospel for every person by the year 2000.&quot; Luis Bush, also a two-thirds world leader from Argentina, accepted his present position with the AD 2000 Movement and Beyond after leaving the directorship of Partners International. More than any other person, he was the one responsible for the 3000-delegate COMIBAM conference in Brazil in 1987, which brought together Spanish and Portuguese leaders from all over the world. As with the Singapore conference, COMIBAM was a missions conference which challenged Latin Americans and Spanish and Portuguese speakers elsewhere to realize that God was calling them also to become missionaries to the unreached peoples/nations of the world. Especially thrilling to these wonderful Christians was the challenge of the Muslim world. But that is another story. Though we shouldn&#39;t have been surprised, those of us who came to Latvia from the West were a bit dismayed to learn that both theological and ethnic divisions run deep, even among Christians in the former Soviet Union. Although the congress was in Latvia, only two or three ethnic Latvians attended. Since 1945, large numbers of ethnic Russians have been moving into the Baltic States. They feel Latvia is their home. Also, although the Soviet empire has collapsed, there is still a strong Soviet army there, and the soldiers do not want to go home. Understandably, then, there is still a great deal of tension. Besides the ethnic distrust, there is a also certain theological disunity among the Christians. Unfortunately, perhaps, all of the local leadership of the Congress was not only ethnically Russian but also Baptist. Consequently, out of 800 delegates, only 50 Pentecostal pastors were present. The delegates evidently recognized the problem this disunity would produce for the goal of evangelizing all of the former Soviet Union because the document they produced and signed stated clearly the need for unity and love. But it will take time as well as the grace of God to bring unity to a fractured church and a splintered society. But what better way to find unity than in the common cause of reaching out with the gospel of our Lord to those who have never heard? The most unique aspect of this particular congress in Riga, however, was the plans for what was to follow the conference. A number of the 200 participants who came from other parts of the world were speakers or workers at the conference. Forty-two, however, came prepared to return with one or another of the delegations from the various republics. There, at the grass roots, they will help train local Christians in saturation evangelism of the entire republic. Some of these &quot;facilitators&quot; planned to stay for months, but most are returning home after two weeks. Because of their presence more than any other factor, this congress was not planned to be just an event but the spark for 15 national congresses during 1993, one in each of the republics and the Baltic States. The Nations for Christ Congress was thus just the beginning of a process, not the end. More than once Dr. Wang insisted, &quot;If this congress is just an event, we will have failed.&quot; Obviously, however, neither Wang nor Bush would be able to stay behind and lead the crucial follow-through all over the 11 time zones. For that job, they chose the Rev. Dwight Small, again a capable younger leader, this time from the U.S. He plans to be supervising this follow-through in the various republics of the former Soviet Union for several months. Coming from the U.S. Center for World Missions where our whole thrust is the unreached peoples (not unevangelized people) of the world, I felt that the distinction between the two was certainly clouded at this congress. Even though various speakers--in particular Dr. Wang, Luis Bush, John Robb of MARC, Don McCurry ministering to Muslims, and my husband, Ralph Winter, tried to make clear the distinction between reached peoples with unevangelized populations and unreached people groups, where the initial penetration of the culture is still to be made, I truly doubt that very many of the Soviets understood just what they were saying. After 70 years of persecution under a communist regime, their focus is almost entirely on their own people, who desperately need to be evangelized. And with the present economic crisis and ethnic conflicts in some areas, the financial problems they face may seem more real than the need to evangelize, I am sure. Some had tears in their eyes when they spoke of the human needs in their various republics, especially the one who represented the devastation in Armenia. But one of the delegates warned that to focus too much on &quot;gifts&quot; promised from abroad might open their people to cult evangelists who were only too eager to win their loyalty. At least 600 groups claiming to be Christian missions have flooded the former Soviet Union with thousands of workers. Some are genuine witnesses to the love of God. Others are false prophets about whom these needy believers need to be warned, even as Paul and Peter so long ago warned the new believers in the Greco-Roman world. It was one of their own missionaries who brought that warning. Working as a missionary among an unreached tribal group in Murmansk near the Arctic Circle, he spoke of the greatest need they have, that of laborers. &quot;What we need most is missionaries,&quot; he said. &quot;We&#39;ll help them build a house. We&#39;ll help feed them.&quot; And everyone laughed when he added, &quot;We have plenty of fish.&quot; At the high point in the final meeting, this man was joined in front by fourteen other Russian cross-cultural missionaries who are already at work among tribal groups in the Arctic Circle. These, we hope and pray, are simply the forerunners of a vast army of home-grown Christian missionaries reaching out to the many unreached peoples of the former Soviet Union. As Jesus said, &quot;The harvest truly is great, but the laborers are few.&quot; Article source: http://www.missionfrontiers.org/issue/article/unprecedented-follow-through-program-for-the-nations-for-christ-congress-in",

    "title": "AD2000 Movement Synopsis",
    "content": "AD2000 Movement Synopsis Rick Wood The AD 2000 and Beyond Movement grew out of a desire to respond both to the imperative of the Great Commission and to the unique opportunity to mobilize all of God&#39;s people to reach the unreached by the year 2000, as God&#39;s people everywhere have established unprecedented faith goals for AD 2000. By July 1990, researchers reported more than 2000 evangelization plans focused on the year 2000. One third of these are from the two-thirds-world. With all the interest in the year 2000, it became apparent that the worldwide body of Christ needs to coordinate its efforts for world evangelization. The following purpose statement was developed in consultation with around 350 Church leaders from all over the world. The overall purpose is stated as follows: In a spirit of servanthood, the people involved in the AD 2000 Movement seek to encourage, motivate and network men and women church leaders by inspiring the vision of reaching the unreached by AD 2000 through consultations, prayer efforts and written materials. The intention is to encourage cooperation among existing churches, movements and structures to work together towards this same vision. The expected result is the establishment of a mission-minded church planting movement within every unreached and unevangelized people and city by AD 2000, so that all people might have a valid opportunity to experience the love, truth and saving power of Jesus Christ in fellowship with other believers. The focus of this movement is on reaching the approximately two billion unreached people who are not within reach of Christians of their own ethnic or people group and do not yet have a vital, indigenous church movement. People refers to the larger ethno- linguistic groups, estimated to be 2,000 among which there are an estimated 11,000 smaller people groups. The two key words for the AD 2000 Movement are, &quot;motivate&quot; and &quot;network.&quot; The two main avenues of sharing the vision are through &quot;national consultations&quot; and &quot;common interest groups.&quot; The focus of the structure is upon a national, regional, and global strategy. The goal of the AD 2000 Movement is to see spiritual initiatives in 200 countries around the world. As of December 31, 1991, interdenominational Christian leaders in over 65 countries around the world have held AD 2000 vision meetings or AD 2000 consultations. The initiative and perspective of a national AD 2000 movement comes from the national leaders. Typically, informed by the global process, national Christian leaders take the initiative to set their own goals focused on the year 2000. The form and focus that the movement takes depends on the perspective of these national leaders. The national AD 2000 plans are responsive to the call of Scripture to reach the unreached as well as the political and economic realities within each of the individual countries where these plans are developed. The sharing of vision comes through consultation as Christian leaders gather in national or regional consultations to share what God is doing around the world. The leaders from these countries involved in these consultations include pastors, denominational leaders, Christian organizational leaders, training institutional leaders, women, young people, and lay people. These national initiatives are formed as national leaders with a vision for the year 2000 form Ad Hoc Steering Committees to bring Christian leaders together to develop and implement mobilization strategies for the national, regional, and global levels. Along with these country-wide and regional spiritual initiatives, there are fourteen global initiatives by interest groups networking together to concentrate on each vital element needed for the cause of world evangelization. Each track is charged with mobilizing the existing forces for evangelism and uniting them, not organizationally, but in prayer, in mutual respect, in interpersonal relationships, and in support of one another through sharing of ideas and resources, to prevent overlap and competition. Within the overall purpose of the AD 2000 and Beyond Movement, each of the interest networks has their own purpose, goals and objectives as they prepare for GCOWE II in 1994. One aspect that underscores the AD 2000 networks is the partnership established between different Christian leaders representing many countries of the world. Each global network typically includes in its leadership one person from the west and one from a two-thirds-world country. As these global network representatives identify, select and recruit regional network representatives, a core group of 12, representing all ten major regions of the world, will come into existence. As each of the regional network representatives select, identify and recruit two representatives for the country, the internationalism of the process becomes increasingly evident. These global AD 2000 initiatives by interest groups are seeking to: Network church leaders for an intensive effort of world evangelization by AD 2000. Intensify, galvanize and accelerate vision for world evangelization within that interest group. Facilitate information exchange between tracks and all interested parties. Encourage cooperative relationships with existing movements, networks and structures that result in coordinated efforts to evangelize unreached peoples and urban centers. Foster concentrated, prevailing prayer against the obstacles for world evangelization. As Christians work through separate but cooperative programs, the AD 2000 Movement hopes that the body of Christ would realize these outcomes. Mobilization of united prayer efforts in every country of the world. Engagement in cooperative ministry efforts to reach the 2000 unreached clusters of peoples. Revitalization of the church leaders for lay mobilization and church renewal. Establishment of an evangelical congregation within easy access of every person in the world. Penetration and evangelization of the unevangelized world by creative missionary methods, such as non-residential missionaries, tent-makers, international returnees and sports evangelism. Equipping of key leadership in every country to develop and implement an effective cross- cultural missionary training program. Establishment of permanent national missiological research functions in every country of the world. Assessment of the progress of evangelization among the 2000 unreached peoples. Engagement in cooperative ministry efforts to reach the 2000 unreached peoples. Provision of a valid opportunity for every person to hear the Gospel in a language they can understand. Establishment of a church planting movement within every unreached people group and city in the country or region. The development of the innate and spiritual gifts of God&#39;s people everywhere, and in particular, women and young people for world evangelization. The AD 2000 Movement is a dynamic institution tailor made to meet the latest trends in missions. It is tapping into the tremendous surge of interest around the world in giving all people everywhere the opportunity to receive Christ as savior by AD 2000. It is also a movement that is raising up international leadership from dozens of countries. AD 2000 is a unique global mission enterprise motivated and carried forward at the initiative of thousands of people from all over the world who have God&#39;s heart to see all peoples reached.

    "title": "World Missions: The Asian Challenge",
    "content": "World Missions: The Asian Challenge Asian Missions Congress &#39;90 Luis Bush August 27, 1990 As I observed the development of Asian Missions Congress &#39;90 unfold and consulted with participants and observers to the conference such as Dr. Emilio Antonio Nunez, Latin American Theologian, Ruben Ezemadu, Chairman of the Nigerian Evangelical Mission Association, Dr. Chun Chae OK from the Women&#39;s University in Seoul, Korea, Dr. Lois McKinney of Trinity Evangelical School the significance began to dawn on me gradually of what was taking place. 1. The Asian Church This was a gathering of the Asian Church. Both the congress name Asia Missions Congress &#39;90 and the theme World Missions - The Asian Challenge made that very clear. Theodore Williams, the keynote speaker said it: &quot;Asia is sometimes referred to as the sleeping giant. But it is the walking giant now. Tremendous things are happening in our continent of Asia. The Church is growing fast and is alive. The missionary awakening in Asia is a significant happening in the past two decades. Never has there been a gathering of all those who are involved in missions in Asia at a grass roots level.&quot; He further pointed out several important facts about Asia as follows: 1) Asia has nearly two thirds of the world population, 2) Asia is the place of origin for many religions, 3) Asia is where human history began and will be consummated and 4) the center of the world&#39;s events are shifting toward Asia. The Congress organizers were Asians. Theodore Williams, the honorary Congress Chairman is from Bangalore, India. Jun Vencer, Chairman of the Coordinating/Executive Committee of AMC &#39;90 is from the Philippines. Met Castillo, the General Congress Coordinator is also from the Philippines. Associate coordinators, Kim Myung Hyuk and Alfred Yeo are from South Korea and Singapore, respectively, Prabhudas Roberts, John Richard from India and Joshua Tsutada of Japan rounded out the coordinating Committee. While Dave Howard, Bill Taylor and I were named Congress Consultants there was no need for consulting. This was an event of the Asian Church by the Asian Church. Some 80% of the Congress funds were generated from Asia. The participants to the Congress had come from throughout Asia. One thousand participants came from 40 countries outside of Korea and 250 more came from Korean. This was indeed an All Asian Conference. There were even two participants from Mongolia. One of them, Altanchimeg had been given a Russian Bible seven years earlier as she was studying at the Mongolian State University in Ulan Bator in her last year in Thermal Engineering. She had thought the Bible was a tale for children but then read several probing questions in the introduction such as: Where are you going? Who are you? and Why are you here in this world? She received Christ and was subsequently jailed and harassed over the next seven years. Like Altanchimeg so many Asians have found their faith in Christ in growing numbers in recent years. Altanchimeg had come to this conference to represent the other Christians in Mongolia and many others like her in Asia. 2. The Asian Church has come together In his message early in the conference, Joshua Tsutada evangelist Honda of Japan sharing the platform set the tone of reconciliation by publicly asking forgiveness of the other Asian Christians particularly the Chinese and the Koreans for offenses committed by their nations armies in recent history. In his introductory remarks Dr. Kim Myung Hyuk, General Secretary of the Korea Evangelical Fellowship and Senior Associate Coordinator of AMC said: &quot;We have gathered here to affirm our oneness in Christ and confirm our common task of world missions. In the past we have not met together.&quot; This indeed was the first time that both church and mission agencies from Asia had met together to discuss the challenge of world missions. 3. The Asian church has come together to contemplate the challenge of World Missions Joshua Tsutada, the Chairman of the Evangelical Fellowship of Asia reviewed the purpose of the Congress on the opening evening. &quot;We have three things to do,&quot; he said, &quot;First, we need to review the past of the missions work of the church in Asia, second, we must survey our present status, and third, we must wait on the Lord as to the future direction of the missions work throughout Asia.&quot; As Kim Joon Gon, Chairman of the Korean Evangelical fellowship said the opening evening: &quot;The next ten years is a time of spiritual emergency. It is a time of opportunity. The Lord Jesus has the keys to open what no one can shut. I believe the next ten years history&#39;s greatest revival will take place in our area. Certainly South Korea and China are a testimony of the evidence to that possibility. But consider even a country like Mongolia. In an article published by Wycliffe news Sept-Nov, 1990 concerning John and Alta Gibbens the reality of this is set forth in the title of the article: I will set before you an open door. The article describes the opening door. &quot;In 1921 Mongolia embraced atheism and became the first Socialist Republic outside the USSR; before that it was a Buddhist stronghold with strong undertones of shamanism. Today, as Marxist regimes all over the world are collapsing, the 1.8 million Mongolians, sandwiched between the Soviet Union and China, are sensing the changes in the air. With their profound Buddhist traditions - 60% if adult men were monks before 1921-they are calling for religious freedom. Economic pressures too are turning the government towards renewed relations with the West...Pressure is mounting for free elections.&quot; During AMC &#39;90 John Gibbens indicated that free elections took place in Mongolia in July. In addition, he shared how government bodies had given orders openly in Mongolian newspapers this past July 14th to introduce 1850 copies of the newly translated Mongolian New Testament and the Mongolian Ministry of Health gave the right to invite Christian relief agenicies through the ministry opened by John and Altaa Gibbens. What an open door to this country of 2.2 million people, six known Christians, with 98% of her people literate, 54% urbanized, 10% in prison, with one-third of the children TB carriers and in desperate need of medication. There is no penicillin in the capital city.. Now it was only a matter of inviting friends from Asia and around the world to come through that door with great care. Similarly other Marxist states are gradually opening their doors to the outside world with commercial links to other countries including China, Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos. It&#39;s into this new world that participants in this conference were focusing their challenge. However, they were also looking beyond to Africa and Latin America as well. In the workshop I gave on opportunities in Latin America, there was a Japanese ministering in Sao Paulo, Brazil, a Korean university professor teaching in Venezuela, a Filipino missionary to Bolivia, an Korean evangelist who was about to tour Latin America with his musical group. During the conference I met Pastor Chang from a missions-minded church I spoke at last year in Singapore who had just returned from s ministry in Nigeria. During my time in his church we had dedicated him for service in Nigeria. Now he had returned and shared that his wife had to have several visits to the hospital in Singapore due to suffering reverse culture shock. Indeed this was a conference dealing with the world missions challenge. 4. The Asian Church has come together to contemplate the challenge of World Missions with a special emphasis on reaching the unreached peoples. We were reminded by Theodore Williams that the largest number of unreached peoples are in Asia and the greatest challenges to the Gospel are also in this continent because of various forces that have made several countries restricted access countries. Howard Peskett of OMF, reported on the work done by the AMC &#39;90 research track committee. He called on the participants to focus on the unreached. In presenting the statistical analysis of the Asian mission field he noted that there were 2,449 unreached peoples among the 27 countries of Asia which have almost 3 billion population. One interesting fact is that he recorded only 364 unreached peoples for India. Like so many Christians in India who do not wish to accept the caste system and acknowledge that there are some 3,000 separate people groups in India the research committee chose to limit itself to the 364 tribal groups of India. It was also interesting to observe that only 158 separate peoples were noted for China. The country with by far the largest number of unreached people groups according to the research committee is Indonesia with 663. This presents the single greatest challenge to the Asian church. Chris Marantika from Indonesia spoke in two plenary sessions and underscored the strategy that has been working for the ministry he has been engaged in to reach Indonesia which he calls &quot;One One One&quot; which means a church for every village in Indonesia in this generation. There is one additional one that he has adopted that fits into the challenge posed by Peskett, which is a church-planting in every unreached people of Indonesia by the year 2000. Next June Chris will lead the S.A. Asia A.D. 2000 Conference in Indonesia and this challenge will certainly be taken up by Christians from S.A. Asia. At the end of his excellent presentation Peskett presented his proposal which he titled: REACHING THE UNREACHED BY AD 2000 (A challenge to Asian Christians). He took his idea from the church leaders in Costa Rica, Central America, who last September held an AD 2000 Conference, called Alcance 2000, in which they came up with a table setting out how 17 nations of Latin America might share in the remaining task of world evangelization. They decided that they should aim to reach 3000 peoples between them and they calculated how the task might be realistically shared. He suggested that Asian evangelicals attempt a similar task and proceeded to list the number of evangelicals in each Asian country and suggested a share of the unreached people according to percentage evangelical of the total evangelicals of Asia. He assigned a responsibility factor on the basis of financial strength which he suggests in effect, multiplies their power to reach out in evangelization. On the basis of his analysis South Korea would have to carry almost one half of the share of unreached peoples followed by India, Indonesia, Philippines and then Taiwan. Despite the rather complicated approach to apportion the unreached peoples by country, the proposal hit a chord in the participants. When James Taylor III clearly endorsed the proposal with a modification to assign responsibility to all Asian countries and not only the ones mentioned by Peskett this increasingly became a goal to be focused on over the next ten years while it is likely there will be more modifications and different interpretations. 5. The Asian Church has come together to contemplate the challenge of World Missions with a special emphasis on reaching the unreached peoples by the year 2000. The year 2000 while not an open theme of AMC &#39;90 was underscored repeatedly by Asian leaders and plenary speakers. In his greetings Rev. Lee Jong-Yun pastor of the Choong Hyun Presbyterian Church of Seoul Korea that was co-hosting the event along with the Korean Evangelical Fellowship said: &quot;With Asia containing the greatest number of restricted access nations and the largest sector of unevangelized people groups, the challenge before us is immense. But with the increase of evangelical momentum building from the Second International congress on World Evangelization in Manila in 1989 and the A.D. 2000 Movements which have sprung into action throughout the world, the advance of the Gospel throughout Asia is equally intense.&quot; Each morning he led the dawn prayer meetings at 5 am. All 7000 chairs were taken, mostly by his own church members. Each morning the subject was &quot;Our challenge for AD 2000.&quot; The first evening Kim Joon Gon, Chairman of the Korean Evangelical Fellowship underscored again and again the vital importance of the next ten years. &quot;The next ten years will be the most strategic...The next ten years are a time of spiritual emergency, a time of opportunity...I believe the next ten years history&#39;s greatest revival will take place in the our area...Call to preach the message of hope in the next ten years....The Great Commission will be fulfilled in the next ten years.&quot; Howard Peskett who brought a key plenary session on the unreached peoples challenged, after careful analysis emerging out of the research done by the AMC &#39;90 research committee presented a specific challenge that: &quot;All unreached peoples , by AD 200, have had and continue to have opportunity to hear and understand the gospel and to receive and follow Christ in the fellowship of culturally-relevant churches.&quot; In his plenary address the next day, James Hudson Taylor III, General Director of Overseas Missionary Fellowship openly endorsed the AD 2000 goal focus suggested by Howard Peskett. 6. The Asian church has come together to contemplate its role in sending forth missionaries to meet the challenge of World Missions with a special emphasis on reaching the unreached by the year 2000. Along with the growing awareness of the need of the unreached people came the realization of the need of increasing the Asian missions force. Peskett presented a rather conservative number of Asian missionaries of 7,500 compared to the 17,299 in the report presented by Larry Pate of OC Ministries to the Lausanne II Congress last year in a book titled From Every People. The difference hinges on how you define &quot;missionary&quot;. As Peskett points out, whichever total you take, the trend is the same. Bong Ro in his plenary noted that this was an annual growth rate of 15.4%. The goal of training and sending qualified missionaries to work among the unreached was emphasized in workshops and throughout the congress. 7. The Asian church has come together to contemplate its role in sending forth spiritually-minded missionaries to meet the challenge of World Missions with a special emphasis on reaching the unreached by the year 2000. Throughout the Congress there was a distinctive emphasis on spirituality. Beginning the first evening with the message of Theodore Williams who underscored the fact that money power and political power have nothing to do with missions. He appealed to the audience to guard against monoculturistic ethnic missions and warned against pragmatic management techniques as we look forward to this decade. He emphasized the need to pay the cost and be prepared to suffer for the sake of the gospel. He called on the church in Asia to shed its minority complex and poverty complex but also to avoid the superior attitude of a conqueror. Petrus Octavianus, a long time mission leader from Indonesia with an annual mission budget of almost $ 1 million, spoke on the tears of Jesus which was a missions outcry to the hearts of the listeners 1) to awaken spiritually, as Lazarus was awakened physically, 2) to be revived out of lukewarmness, as Jesus cried over the spiritual indifference of Jerusalem, and 3) to become empassioned with lostness of the world without Christ, as Jesus cried in the garden of Gethsemane as he was praying not only for himself but also in what he was to do for the salvation of unreached peoples worldwide. No doubt this was a significant meeting of God&#39;s people in Asia that will shape expectations and outcomes in years to come, particularly until the year 2000. In the closing message of the Congress John Richard, who, following the Congress is to begin to work full time with the AD 2000 Movement, addressed concerns that are spiritual as a pre-requisite to outcomes that are global taking as his biblical basis Psalm 67. He called on the church in Asia to recognize their hopelessness and their emptiness and their helplessness and their lostness and their sickness to then expect outcomes such as the knowledge of God, the salvation of God, the praise of God, the kingdom of God. He concluded with a practical appeal for increased spirituality, to awake, pray, walk circumspectly, serve selflessly and suffer gladly. In conclusion, there was a real sense of urgency present throughout the Congress perhaps best summarized by the words of Joshua Tsutada of Japan when he said: &quot;...This may be the last page. Night is coming when no man can work.&quot;",

    "content": "The Asia Challenge &quot;To Awaken the Churches&quot; Jack Frizen June 1, 1990 Seoul. Home of some of the largest churches in the world. In Korea, a country that 90 years ago was deemed &quot;impenetrable by the Gospel&quot; and now is nearly 35% Christian. Asia. Comprising half the world&#39;s population and thousands of totally unreached people groups. With more than 37,000 missionaries worldwide now coming from the Two- Thirds World, it&#39;s high time we in the West knew what God is doing to mobilize the awesome mission forces of the East. Dr. Frizen, Executive Director of the Interdenominational Foreign Mission Association, will present the following report at the IFMA meetings September 18th--the joint IFMA-EFMA executives&#39; retreat in Denver, Colorado: &quot;World Mission: The Asian Challenge&quot; was the theme of Asia Missions Congress &#39;90 held August 27-31 in Seoul, Korea. The Evangelical Fellowship of Asia sponsored the congress which was eighteen months in preparation. Hosts were the Korea Evangelical Fellowship and the 25,000-member Choong Hyun Presbyterian Church that made its ample facilities available for all the sessions of the congress. The 1,250 participants and speakers were overwhelmingly Asian pastors, missionaries and other Christian workers. I was one of the 52 church and mission leaders invited from Africa, Europe, Latin America and North America. As observers, we were included in all AMC activities. Fifty countries, mostly Asian, were represented. The thoroughly conservative evangelical congress was conducted from start to finish with a balanced blend of worship, celebration and missiological teaching based solidly on the Word of God. The purpose of the gathering was clearly stated as follows: To review and reevaluate the past work of missions in Asia and to analyze the current needs and to strategize for the future advancement of Christ&#39;s kingdom in Asia. To awaken the churches in Asia for missions involvement and responsibility. To mobilize the churches in Asia for mission in an increasing measure. To promote better cooperation in training, networking and partnership in missions among churches and mission agencies in Asia. In his keynote address, Dr. Theodore Williams, India mission leader and president of the World Evangelical Fellowship, gave a powerful exposition of the congress theme. He outlined a clear agenda for the meeting and for Asian churches and mission until the return of our Lord. Among the important plenary sessions were: An Historical Analysis of Mission in Asia by Dr. Bong Rin Ro of Overseas Missionary Fellowship, Asian Theological Association and the Theological Commission of the WEF; Report of the AMC &#39;90 Research Track Committee by Rev. Howard Peskett of OMF; Two-Thirds World Mission and World Evangelization by Dr. Larry Keyes of Overseas Crusades Ministries; Church and Mission Relationship by Rev. Jun Vercer, general secretary fo the Philippine Council of Christian Churches. A compendium of the total congress is envisioned pending funding. All other expenses of the congress have been met, with the majority of funds coming from Asia. Asian Commitment to the Task Four of the ten committments made refer specifically to local churches in Asia: To make the great commission the primary focus of our personal ministry, and that of the churches and organizations we represent. To do all possible to ensure that the cause of world evangelization becomes an integral part of the life of every local church, association of churches and denominations. To mobilize the entire membership of local congregations to pray, give, and send or go, regardless of their economic or political status. To ensure that missions is made an essential part of every level of Christian education in our local churches and institutions. During one of the sessions, pastors were asked to stand. It appeared that a large majority of participants were pastors. If these pastors follow through with the committments enthusiastically approved in the AMC &#39;90 Declaration, the cause of world evangelization should be greatly strengthened by the participation of the churches represented. Follow-up of the congress was committed to Dr. David Lee of Korea and the AMC Coordinating Committee, which represents the leadership of the Evangelical Fellowship of Asia (EFA). WEF Leadership Throughout the sessions of the Asia Mission Congress &#39;90, the importance of the World Evangelical Fellowship was highlighted. At the concluding service the WEF International Executive Council members were introduced. It was announced that Dr. Agustin B. (Jun) Vancer, Jr. of the Philippines had accepted the Council&#39;s invitation to become the next international director to succeed Dr. David Howard after the 9th General Assembly in 1992. The World Evangelical Fellowship is a key organization in the preservation of a conservative evangelical position world wide. The Declaration The overall sense of commitment expressed during the conference is probably best seen in the official declaration of Asia Mission Congress &#39;90: THE ASIAN RESPONSE We, the 1302 participants and observers from 50 nations, have gathered in Seoul, Korea in August 1990 for the Asia Missions Congress. We acknowledge the timeliness of this historic Congress, the first of its kind in Asia. We give thanks to God for both the inspiration given to the Evangelical Fellowship of Asia in sponsoring this Congress, and the generosity of the Korea Evangelical Fellowship and the Choong Hyun Presbyterian Church in hosting it. We look back in gratitude to the sacrificial and fruitful labors of missionaries, mostly from the West, who faithfully sowed the seed of the gospel through which the Church has been planted in our lands over the past 200 years. While we have been disappointed by some of the cultural insensitivities of those who have brought the gospel to our lands, we confess we have been guilty of similar cultural domination in some of our own missionary endeavors. We look to the present in praise to God for the growth and maturing of the Church in Asia. As evidence of this we rejoice in the rapid growth and development of the Asian missionary movement. We therefore renew our commitment to complete the task of world missions in reliance upon the Holy Spirit. We have gathered to look to the future in faith believing that God purposes to use us to carry the gospel to every part of our own continent, and beyond, to the entire unevangelized world. We are deeply aware of the exciting opportunities before us for evangelism in a chaotic and changing world. We pledge our best efforts to ensure that this Congress will effect an urgent and complete mobilization of the Asian Church for the purposes of world evangelism. We affirm: The absolute authority of the inerrant Scriptures in our lives, and that therein God reveals His redemptive plan to incorporate those of every race, tribe, people and tongue in the Church, the body of Christ. The lostness of all mankind in sin and that it is only through faith in Christ Jesus, the unique and eternal Son of God, that salvation and reconciliation with God is obtained. The importance and urgency of the Great Commission to make disciples of all peoples which is to be obeyed by every Christian in all parts of the world. The centrality of the local church as God&#39;s instrument for world evangelization, and for the necessity of every part of the Church, including agencies and institutions, to work in missions with unity of purpose. The sufficiency of the gospel as revealed in the Scriptures to meet the need of all mankind whatever his spiritual, physical, cultural, economic or ideological condition may be. We commit ourselves: To make the Great Commission the primary focus of our personal ministry, and that of the churches and organizations we represent. To do all possible to ensure that the cause of world evanglization become an integral part of the life of every local church, association of churches and denominations. To research the status of evangelization in our nations by: Establishing, supporting and developing national,research centers. Analyzing the status and growth of the Church. Identifying the less evangelized segments of the national population--whether people groups, cities, or regions. Disseminating the results of that research to national churches and agencies to encourage thinking, stimulate ,prayer and the development of strategies for missions. To mobilize the entire membership of local congregations to pray, give and send or go regardless of their economic or political status. To a partnership in world evagelization within the body of Christ, to counteract the divisions that have often hindered us, that is between: churches and mission agencies, national and international bodies, missionaries of different nationalities on fields. To ensure that missions is made an essential part of every level of Christian education in our local churches and institutions. To provide adequate training for prospective and in-service missionaries within their own country where possible. To make full use of all ministries for the most effective evangelization of the unreached. To set up the ongoing mechanisms and structures that will unite us in the implementation of these commitments made at AMC &#39;90. , 10. To a personal and corporate ministry of prayer in dependence on the Holy Spirit and His power as an essential prerequisite for revival in the Church, effective spiritual warfare and the accomplishment of these visions. Conclusion We give praise to God for AMC &#39;90. God has met with us here. We have heard the challenge of world missions, and we, the Christians and churches of Asia, respond by taking up that challenge. We call on all fellow believers to the same. We expect a great harvest in this decade and, ultimately, the realization of the biblical vision of Revelation 7:9-10. &quot;...a great multitude which no man could number, from every nation, from all tribes and peoples and tongues, standing before the throne and before the Lamb, clothed in white robes....&quot; Editor&#39;s Note: As laudable as the Asian Mission Conference &#39;90 was, is it not odd that throughout the proceedings, very little mention seems to have been made about the completion of mission to the unreached peoples? Did AMC &#39;90 copy the oversights of some Western mission experience which bypasses emphasis on the unreached and closure in favor of addressing the concerns of national churches? (See Dr. Winter&#39;s comments page 2.) We welcome clarification from any particpants in AMC &#39;90. --Bill Stearns Article source: http://www.missionfrontiers.org/issue/article/the-asia-challenge",

    "content": "Exposition of Colossians Chapter One, Urbana 1990 Luis Bush Introduction: Jesus Christ, Lord of the universe, hope for the world. I discovered the meaning of that statement in what has happened in Argentina in recent years. An Argentine citizen, with a British mother and Argentinian father when, the Falkland Island crisis hit, I found myself in a crisis. Serving in a church in El Salvador at the time they were all rooting for Argentina. Knowing of my background they asked me: &quot;Who do you think those islands belong to?&quot; After thinking about it I said: &quot;I think those islands belong to the Lord Jesus Christ. He is the Lord of the universe and the Lord of those Islands.&quot;&quot; An Argentinian Nobel prize winner by the name of Borges who tried to capture the significance of the Falkland Islands crisis said it was just like two bald men fighting over a comb. But that was not how the young people of Argentina saw it. To them it was a crisis of authority. Waking up to the fact that they had been misled by their earthly leaders an authority vacuum was created of enormous proportions leading to military, political and social upheaval. But in the midst of the chaos the written Word and the living Word of God were lifted up and multitudes of Argentinians came to recognize that it is Jesus who is Lord. Carlos Anaconda was a businessman and deacon in his church when one Wednesday evening the pastor of the small church he was attending did not show up. He was invited to give a short message. Despite the encouragement of his wife who was sitting beside him, he did not budge. A second time his name was mentioned but he said to himself &quot;I can&#39;t preach.&quot; Even with his wife&#39;s nudging he did not move. The third time his wife&#39;s nudge became a jab and he jumped up and spoke. God blessed his word and so he was invited to speak again. This time he said, &quot;Yes.&quot; At first, he preached in the church, but it was too small, so would go to the soccer fields, set up his equipment and preach. Hundreds then thousands ... 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 50,000 came to his meetings. His message was typically on the authority and Lordship of Jesus Christ. In the meetings held in Mar del Plata, 90,000 public decisions were made for Christ. Never had anything like this been seen in Argentina. But the apostle Paul had said it before in his letter to the Colossian Church in Chapter one and verse 19, &quot;For God was pleased to have all his fullness dwell in him,&quot; that is Christ, &quot;and through him to reconcile to himself all things, whether things on earth or things in heaven, by making peace through his blood, shed on the Cross.&quot; Take note; Carlos was a deacon and a businessman, yet God used him to bring 90,000 people to a public decision for Christ in one city alone. During your time here in Urbana you may question your ability to be a missionary or take part in some other unique opportunity to proclaim Christ at school or abroad. But with all the fullness of Christ in you there is no basis for doubt. Just as there was a tremendous vacuum for authority and hope in Argentina, we are approaching a vacuum of a greater force. As we approach the year 2000 people all over the world are looking back at history and questioning authority. Walls are falling. The iron curtain is opening, through which Jesus, Lord of the universe, is being proclaimed. At your schools there is a vacuum in the hearts of your classmates. Looking back in American history, drugs are out, the consequence of sexual sin apparent; and they were revolutions of the youth. Symbols of the past are being discarded as people all over the world look toward the future. John Naisbitt, in his book Megatrends 2000 states that the year 2000 is the most powerful symbol of our lifetime, a symbol of the future. Two years ago, in a Wall Street Journal article, it was stated that every major corporation would have a product with 2000 in its name. There are 2000 towel dispensers. You can fill up a Pontiac Sunbird 2000 with SU2000 gas on the way to an eye exam 2000 and the list goes on. But, more importantly, A.D. 2000 is a date that God&#39;s Spirit is using to unite his body of believers in a common goal of completing the Great Commission. You are alive at a significant point of history. The largest movement of youth in missions at a time when the world is looking at a date that tells all that our very history recorded in reference to the life of Jesus Christ. Keep in mind where you are in history, your particular situation amidst the vacuum of this generation as we go on and continue to see how God filled the vacuum in Argentina. Into that same authority vacuum walked a man by the name of by the name of Hector Gimenez. Hector had experienced the Lordship of Christ in his life giving him victory over a drug addiction problem. He rented a theater in the heart of Buenos Aires and began to share his testimony and the fact that there is power in the name of the Lord. People would line up all around the block waiting to get in. Today meetings are held every three hours throughout the week and there are over 100,000 people attending the meetings. Gimenez learned what Paul had said to the Colossian Church in chapter one and verse 21, &quot;once you were alienated from God and were enemies in your minds because of your evil behavior. But now he has reconciled you by Christ&#39;s physical body through death to present you holy in his sight without blemish and free from accusation - if you continue in your faith, established and firm, not moved from the hope held out in the gospel.&quot; Argentina has been discovering that Jesus Christ is the Lord of the universe and the hope for the world. Today in your life those around you can discover the same as you allow the fulness of Christ to be manifested in your lives daily. JESUS CHRIST, LORD OF THE UNIVERSE, HOPE FOR THE WORLD. That is the theme of this Urbana Conference and of the first chapter of Paul&#39;s letter to the Colossian church.

    "title": "Alcance 2000: Costa Rican Evangelicals Poised for Mission Advance",
    "content": "Alcance 2000: Costa Rican Evangelicals Poised for Mission Advance INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FRONTIER MISSIONS, VOL 7:1 JAN 1990 In 1989, 20 national and regional consultations have been held around the world focusing in on what can be done in world evangelization by the year 2000 and beyond. Luis Bush gives his first-hand experience of Alcance 2000 held in Costa Rica. Luis Bush Costa Rican evangelicals drew up strategic plans to develop the growing missions’ momentum in this tiny Central American nation at “Alcance 2000,” a mission’s congress held in San Jose, Costa Rica, in August 1989. Freedom and Stability Costa Rican missionary effort has benefited from the country&#39;s peaceful democracy and one of the most stable economies in Latin America. Dr. Oscar Arias, President of Costa Rica, recently received the Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts for peace in an otherwise turbulent Central America. As agents of peace and freedom, Costa Ricans are welcome in most places. With no standing army, the nation maintains a neutral posture in an otherwise turbulent region. Thus, ambassadors for Christ from Costa Rica not only present no threat but are usually well-received in other parts of the world. Fullness of Blessing The growth of the evangelical church in Costa Rica is another reason for its missionary initiative. As a result of the fullness of God&#39;s blessing in the evangelical church in Costa Rica, many talks of the unusual work of God in the nation in recent years. For some from the Catholic tradition or others who maintain a secular humanist perspective, the growth of the evangelical church constitutes a cause for alarm. The press has featured the church in recent reports. For example, on July 25, 1989, the weekly magazine, Rumbo, used a tambourine, a typical instrument of worship in evangelical churches, on the front cover, touting the article reports that the Protestant community in Costa Rica exceeds one-half million or 18 percent out of a total population of 2.8 million people. This compares to one percent in 1949 and 10 percent in 1980, according to CECODERS, a Catholic center in Costa Rica. The writer of the article observed, &quot;On Sunday mornings, it is normal to see groups of men, women, and children with Bibles under their arms going to church or house to house.&quot; This article was preceded by a six-page article in the previous week&#39;s edition of Rumbo on the same subject, as well as a major newspaper article in the July 19 daily Prensa under the heading &quot;Democracy and Message Augments Protestantism.&quot; While non-evangelicals may be un-easy about the rapid growth of the evangelical church, Costa Rican Christians rejoice in what God is doing. But they also recognized the danger of compla-cency and prayerlessness. Thus, the first day of Alcance 2000 was dedicated to seeking God for a national movement of united prayer for spiritual awakening and a new mission thrust. Reminding themselves of the history, principles, and models of great prayer movements of the past, participants met by geographic regions to strategize and to pray for a united movement of prayer in their region, for a renewed vision of Christ, for restored unity and resolve, and an expanded ministry to the unreached by the year 2000. Fulfillment of Plans The Alcance 2000 conference in Costa Rica is part of a process that draws from the spirit of two previous movements. The first is COMIBAM (Cooperation in Missions in Ibero-American outgrowth of the COMIBAM conference in Sao Paulo, Brazil, 1987) a co-sponsor of the Alcance 2000 event. Alcance 2000 also unites with the spirit and conviction of the AD 2000 movement, born out of the Global Consultation on World Evangelization by the Year 2000 and Beyond (GCOWE) held in January 1989 in Singapore. The Great Commission Manifesto, one of the results from the GCOWE Consultation, which commits Christians to the goal of world evangelization by the year 2000 and beyond, was prominent in the front pages of the congress document, Alcance 2000. The declaration of Alcance 2000 in Costa Rica affirmed the commitment to consider the year 2000 as a strategic date for the evangelization of Costa Rica and the world. In the first section of the document, entitled “Our 2000 Agenda,” pastors and denominational leaders committed themselves to the goal of sending between 200 and 500 missionaries to start a church-planting movement among 30 to 50 unreached people groups by the year 2000. The participants considered this the Costa Rican church&#39;s proportional part of the challenge of reaching the 12,000 remaining unreached people groups in the world. This goal was based on the percentage of evangelicals in Costa Rica in relation to the total number of evangelicals in Latin America and the world. Short-term Efforts The Costa Rican church has already begun to work towards this goal. Missions efforts from Costa Rica have increased dramatically in the last five years. Since 1985, when the first missionary conference in Costa Rica was held and the first interdenominational mission agency was established, churches have sent over 60 short-termers to the city of Medellin in Columbia and to Mexico City as part of the “Christ for the City” program. Another 40 have traveled to the Amazonian provinces of Peru to establish a missionary and evangelist training school, and for church planting. The Amazonian Mission of Costa Rica was organized in 1985, and the target of this mission is the 1,000-kilometer square, inhospitable Amazonian jungle area, including the four provinces of Peru: Loreto, Ucayali , San Martin, and Amazonas. A training school has been established in Iquitos, which today trains 112 local evangelists in a six-month program. The three launches of the Costa Rican Amazonian Mission carry evangelists to share the Gospel with nineteen tribes who live along the banks of various rivers. Nineteen churches have been established among the tribes, particularly the Urartians, Chivas, and Comillas. Juan Javier, an Indian from the area, received Christ. Not knowing how to read or write, he memorized John 3:16, and has established a small church in his village using only that one verse. Although the location is only accessible by a one-and-a-half-hour flight from Lima, 40 short-termers have gone to serve from Costa Rica in a mission financed entirely by Costa Ricans. But missions’ leaders in Costa Rica believe the major emphasis should be to send missionaries to long-term missions’ assignments which they believe will bear more fruit in completing the unfinished task. Long-term Efforts A Spanish-speaking team was sent to Spain two years ago, including a gifted denominational leader and a musician. They founded the Spanish Institute for Evangelism in Depth to train pastors and church leaders. They also planted a growing church of more than 40 members in a short period of time. Another major initiative by the Costa Rican church is to care for Nicaraguan refugees in Costa Rica, and to encourage the church in Nicaragua. Costa Rican missionaries have been working in evangelism and discipleship and will be assisting in the organization of the first Nicaraguan missionary conference of Alcance 2000 in December of this year. Dr. Julio Becas, an orthodontist, has been sent to an unreached people group among the Muslims in North Africa. Another medical missionary is studying Arabic in preparation to working with Muslims in North Africa. A training school in the jungle in Costa Rica, led by Peter Jones, a Costa Rican missionary, provides preparation for long-term missions work to minister to animistic tribal groups. A Small Country Sets the Pace for Other AD 2000 Initiatives It was in July 1985 that the first missionary conference in Costa Rica was held, in which 44 denominational and Christian organizations participated. The consultations in 1985 became a model and a prototype for other consultations throughout Latin America and the Iberian section of Europe. This was the first of a series of 30 other national consultations which were part of the COMIBAM process leading up to the conference in November 1987. In the same way, the Alcance 2000 consultation seems likely to become a prototype for other initiatives through-out Latin America, as plans are now underway for similar congresses in Chile in October 1989; in Argentina in November 1989 for the six countries of the Southern Cone; in Paraguay, Uruguay, Nicaragua, Colombia for the Andean countries; and Puerto Rico for the Caribbean countries. The materials from this conference will be shared with the other organizers, and there will be a cross-fertilization of ideas. In other regions of the world, plans for national and regional AD 2000 consultations are already underway: in West Asia, with the representation of 11 countries in the Middle East; in Africa, with Zaire, Ghana, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, and other countries. Among the Chinese, a network of 6,000 outside of mainland China will be having their GCOWE in North America and an international conference in the next two years. Other consultations will be held in the South Pacific in December 1989; in South Asia, Southeast Asia, and Europe, including Belgium, Italy, and France. National network leaders representing affinity groups in their countries of the AD 2000 movement will be asked to participate in the GCOWE II conference planned for July 1-15, 1994, and for an evaluation of the progress of world evangelization, particularly in terms of the adoption and initial penetration of the 12,000 unreached people groups as well as their efforts within their own countries and the cities of the world. The church in Costa Rica may also be setting a model for targeting a number of unreached people groups in proportion to their percentage of the total evangelical population. A Modern Day Jonah But while God is using cooperative efforts and strategic planning in this accelerating program of world evangelization, the Costa Rican conference also highlighted the importance of individual obedience. At the first missionary conference held in Costa Rica in 1985, Rafael Baltodano was over 65 years old. As one of the leaders of the “Evangelism-in-Depth” program, he had served effectively to encourage the mobilization of the church for evangelism in many countries in Latin America. As a respected leader in Costa Rica, he was one of the speakers at the first missions con-sultation. Out of that meeting came the proposal to establish the first Costa Rican interdenominational mission agency. By the second day of the constitution, Rafael began feeling ill. He recognized that the momentum of the consultation was growing and a definite interest in supporting the establishment of this mission agency was escalating. But his physical weakness reinforced his conviction that he had done his share in the work of the Lord. He decided to slip quietly out of the conference before he was asked to do anything. He went to his room and collected his belongings. With his bags in the car, he turned on the ignition, but nothing happened. He asked several people standing nearby to give him a push, but to no avail. Rafael had no other choice but to go back to his room, unpack his things and return to the conference. Sure enough, when it came time to choose a committee to lead in the finalizing of plans that lead to the formation of the new mission agency, his was the first name suggested. Rather sheepishly he lifted his hand and agreed, “I&#39;m available; I&#39;m ready.” When the conference was over, he got in his car to leave. This time when he turned the ignition, the car started immediately. Rafael later told his friends that, like Jonah, he was thankful to be called a second time. So, today, at almost 72 years of age, Rafael Baltodano continues to actively serve the Lord and to encourage the missionary thrust out of his country. God is using many like Rafael in Costa Rica to move the growing evangelical church forward in its role in world evangelization. Alcance 2000 is a positive commitment to the race to complete the goal by the year 2000 and a celebration of its ultimate victor, Jesus Christ, whether we make the goal or not! Luis Bush is the international president of Partners, International, formerly known as CNEC, based in San Jose, California. While overseeing partnerships with more than 70 strategic national ministries in 50 countries, he continues to act as a catalyst in the gathering momentum of world evangelization by the year 2000. The church in Costa Rica may also be setting a model for targeting a number of unreached people groups in proportion to their percentage of the total evangelical population.

    "content": "The Challenge of AD 2000 and Beyond: The Manila Manifesto John Stott and others Affirmation 11. The Challenge of AD 2000 and Beyond The world population today is approaching 6 billion people. One third of them nominally confess Christ. Of the remaining four billion half have heard of him and the other half have not. In the light of these figures, we evaluate our evangelistic task by considering four categories of people. First, there is the potential missionary work force, the committed. In this century this category of Christian believers has grown from about 40 million in 1900 to about 500 million today, and at this moment is growing over twice as fast as any other major religious group. Secondly, there are the uncommitted. They make a Christian profession (they have been baptized, attend church occasionally, and even call themselves Christians), but the notion of a personal commitment to Christ is foreign to them. They are found in all churches throughout the world. They urgently need to be re-evangelized. Thirdly, there are the unevangelized. These are people who have a minimal knowledge of the gospel, but have had no valid opportunity to respond to it. They are probably within reach of Christian people if only these will go to the next street, road, village, or town to find them. Fourthly, there are the unreached. These are the two billion who may never have heard of Jesus as Savior, and are not within reach of Christians of their own people. There are, in fact, some 2,000 peoples or nationalities in which there is not yet a vital, indigenous church movement. We find it helpful to think of them as belonging to smaller ‘people groups’ which perceive themselves as having an affinity with each other (eg a common culture, language, home, or occupation). The most effective messengers to reach them will be those believers who already belong to their culture and know their language. Otherwise, cross-cultural messengers of the gospel will need to go, leaving behind their own culture and sacrificially identifying with the people they long to reach for Christ. There are now about 12,000 such unreached people groups within the 2,000 larger peoples, so that the task is not impossible. Yet at present only 7% of all missionaries are engaged in this kind of outreach, while the remaining 93% are working in the already evangelized half of the world. If this imbalance is to be redressed, a strategic redeployment of personnel will be necessary. A distressing factor that affects each of the above categories is that of inaccessibility. Many countries do not grant visas to self-styled missionaries, who have no other qualification or contribution to offer. Such areas are not absolutely inaccessible, however. For our prayers can pass through every curtain, door, and barrier. And Christian radio and television, audio and video cassettes, films and literature can also reach the otherwise unreachable. So can so-called “”tent-makers” who like Paul earn their own living. They travel in the course of their profession (eg business people, university lecturers, technical specialists, and language teachers), and use every opportunity to speak of Jesus Christ. They do not enter a country under false pretences, for their work genuinely takes them there; it is simply that witness is an essential component of their Christian lifestyle, wherever they may happen to be. We are deeply ashamed that nearly two millennia have passed since the death and resurrection of Jesus, and still two-thirds of the world’s population have not yet acknowledged him. On the other hand, we are amazed at the mounting evidence of God’s power even in the most unlikely places of the globe. Now the year 2000 has become for many a challenging milestone. Can we commit ourselves to evangelize the world during the last decade of this millennium? There is nothing magical about the date, yet should we not do our best to reach this goal? Christ commands us to take the gospel to all peoples. The task is urgent. We are determined to obey him with joy and hope.

    "content": "Lausanne Manila Manifesto (AD 2000 Section) Calling the whole church to the whole Gospel to the whole world John Stott In July 1974 the International Congress on World Evangelization was held in Lausanne, Switzerland, and issued the Lausanne Covenant. Now in July 1989 over 3,000 of us from about 170 countries have met in Manila for the same purpose, and have issued the Manila Manifesto. We are grateful for the welcome we have received for our Filipino brothers and sisters. During the 15 years which have elapsed between the two congresses some smaller consultations have been held on topics like the Gospel and Culture, Evangelism and Conversion. These meetings and their reports have helped to develop the thinking of the Lausanne movement. A &quot;manifesto&quot; is defined as a public declaration of convictions, intentions and motives. The Manila Manifesto takes up the two congress themes, &quot;Proclaim Christ until he comes,&quot; and &quot;Calling the Whole Church to take the Whole Gospel to the Whole World.&quot; Its first part is a series of 21 succinct affirmations. Its second part elaborates these in 12 sections, which are commended to churches, alongside the Lausanne Covenant, for study and action. The following is an excerpt from Point C, The Whole World, taken from The Manila Manifesto of the Lausanne II conference. The Challenge of AD 2000 and Beyond The world population today is approaching 6 billion. One third of them nominally confess Christ.

So can so called &quot;tent-makers&quot; who like Paul earn their own living. They travel in the course of their profession (e.g., business people, university lecturers, technical specialists and language teachers) and use every opportunity to speak of Jesus Christ. They do not enter a country under false pretenses, for their work generally takes them there; it is simply that witness is an essential component of their Christian lifestyle, wherever they may happen to be. We are deeply ashamed that nearly two millennia have passed since the death and resurrection of Jesus, and still two-thirds of the world&#39;s population have not acknowledged him. On the other hand, we are amazed that the mounting evidence of God&#39;s power even in the most unlikely places of the globe. Now the year 2000 has become for many a challenging milestone. Can we commit ourselves to evangelize the world during the last decade of this millennium? There is nothing magical about the date, yet should we not do our our best to reach this goal? Christ commands us to take the gospel to all people. The task is urgent. We are determined to obey Him with joy and hope. Article source: http://www.ad2000.org/handbook/manila.htm",

    "content": "The Legacy of the Lausanne Movement Lausanne For over 40 years, the Lausanne Movement has ‘set the table’ and convened leaders for a number of global gatherings and catalytic networks that, by God’s grace, have impacted the scope of world missions. Today Lausanne continues to fulfill its unique calling to connect leaders across regions, issues, and generations to collaboratively and prayerfully work toward the advancement of the gospel. Learn More about Lausanne’s Unique Calling The beginnings of the Lausanne Movement Our story begins with the evangelist Dr Billy Graham. As he started preaching internationally, he developed a passion to ‘unite all evangelicals in the common task of the total evangelization of the world’. In the 1970s, Billy Graham perceived the need for a global congress to reframe Christian mission in a world of political, economic, intellectual, and religious upheaval. The church, he believed, had to grasp the ideas and values behind rapid changes in society. In July 1974, over 2,400 participants from 150 nations gathered in Lausanne, Switzerland, for the First International Congress on World Evangelization. TIME magazine described it as ‘a formidable forum, possibly the widest-ranging meeting of Christians ever held’. Listen to Billy Graham’s Opening Address Those who attended remember with gratitude God’s presence and favor on those ten days of prayer and planning for global mission, which galvanized the church in three major ways: Theological foundation for global mission The Lausanne Covenant, drafted by an international committee chaired by John Stott, has come to be regarded as one of the most significant documents in modern church history. It defined the necessity and goals of evangelism, bringing together evangelicals from diverse backgrounds and shaping much of their endeavours for the rest of the century. Read The Lausanne Covenant and John Stott’s Commentary Unreached people groups Hailed as ‘one of the milestone events in missiology’, Ralph Winter’s plenary address in 1974 introduced the now ubiquitous term ‘unreached people groups’. Winter contended that cross-cultural mission needed to be the primary task of the church, as thousands of ethnic groups remained without a single Christian and with no access to Scripture in their language. Learn about the Least Evangelized People Issue Network Holistic mission The Congress urged the necessity of both evangelism and social justice in mission, with the voices of Latin American theologians Samuel Escobar and Rene Padilla among the clearest to be heard. This created a paradigm shift for much of the evangelical thinking of the time, and today the widespread embrace of holistic, or integral, mission can largely be attributed to the 1974 Congress. Learn more about the Integral Mission Issue Network Manila 1989: New Global Partnerships In 1989, the Second International Congress on World Evangelization was held in Manila, Philippines. There was notable involvement from the Soviet Union, Eastern Europe, women, and laity. Manila 1989 served as a launch pad for further key strategies and milestones in global mission: 10/40 Window Luis Bush built on Ralph Winter’s 1974 presentation of unreached people groups (UPGs) by identifying the geographical region where the majority of UPGs are located. The concept of the 10/40 Window has helped numerous mission agencies and churches to focus their ministries between the 10 to 40 degree latitudinal areas of North Africa, the Middle East, and Asia. Global partnerships Over 300 mission partnerships, networks, and new ministries came out of Manila 1989 to address a wide range of critical missional issues. Many of these new partnerships were among groups working in the majority world. Cape Town 2010: A Platform for the Global Church Christianity Today described the Third Lausanne Congress on World Evangelization in Cape Town as ‘a younger, more ethnically diverse, and more geographically varied consortium of evangelical leaders than ever before’. Cape Town 2010 was carefully assembled to depict an accurate demographic of the global church, giving particular voice to the church in the majority world. Issue networks: Following the CTC road map Over 30 pressing missional challenges, most with a corresponding issue network, were identified in The Cape Town Commitment (CTC). These included the advance of the gospel among oral learners, in diaspora communities, in the world of ideas, and in every sphere of society including the marketplace, the academy, and the public square. The CTC captures what we believe the Holy Spirit is saying to the church in our times and serves as a road map for the activities of the Movement. Today influencers continue to gather through these issue networks and in other global consultations focused on critical missions topics. The networks and consultations often publish resources for leaders around the world, which continue to help shape mission theology and practice. Learn about the hundreds of videos, articles, and other missional resources freely available through our content library. Explore Lausanne Issue Networks Browse Lausanne Content Library Engaging Generations of Younger Leaders For every generation since 1987, Lausanne has held a Younger Leaders Gathering (YLG) to identify and bring together emerging influencers from around the world. The gatherings connect younger leaders with each other and with other senior global leaders to build up the next generation of influencers and encourage leadership development. The first two YLGs were held in Singapore in 1987 and Malaysia in 2006. The third YLG in 2016 (YLG2016) was held in Jakarta, Indonesia, convening more than 1,000 younger leaders and mentors from over 140 countries. In conjunction with YLG2016, a new initiative called the Younger Leaders Generation (YLGen) was launched as a commitment to intentionally mentor emerging influencers over the span of ten years. Connecting Today’s Influencers for Global Mission While much has changed in the more than 40 years since the first Lausanne Congress, our focus on connecting influencers and ideas for global mission continues to be our unique role in God’s global mission.

    "title": "The Challenge Before Us - Lausanne II Congress",
    "content": "The Challenge Before Us - Lausanne II Congress Luis Bush How can we describe the challenge before us at the Lausanne II Congress in Manila? Perhaps it can be described by something we have experienced. This was true for me one day right here in Manila, when I met Andrew. For two years, he had been proclaiming Christ in a community of some seven thousand people who made their living off the garbage dump of Manila. We put on boots, and as we walked to the dumps, I saw a group of people swimming in the river that flows out to the Manila Bay and to the Pacific. As in other cities around the world, the water is completely polluted. The houses are one-room shacks where entire families live. While we were in the area, a woman approached us. She was crying. In her hand, she carried a bag which contained the remains of her infant baby who had died only a short while before. She did not have the money needed to give the baby a decent burial, and had approached Andrew for help. Trucks daily unload the garbage onto a smoldering heap of refuse. At the top of the dump, which smokes six months out of the year, it was a shock to see young and old scavenging-picking up broken bottles and old tin cans to sell to recyclers. As I looked over the smoking dump on the one side and the community of people on the other with the river in the distance leading out to the Manila Bay, I thought, What a graphic picture of the world in which we live. What a graphic picture of the challenge before us. The challenge before us is to work together with understanding, in a rapidly growing urban world which is increasingly unfriendly. We need to work together in an attitude of dependence on the Lord Jesus Christ and the Holy Spirit, to mobilize all the forces within the body of Christ in every country of the world to fulfill the Great Commission. We must strive to proclaim the gospel to every people group, and to obey the Great Commandment by demonstrating love for the whole person as we approach the year 2000 and until he comes. To Work Together With Understanding During my time at the dump community in Manila, I was moved by what I saw, There was a team of about twenty people working together in harmony. They proclaimed the gospel and sacrificially served the community. Among them were young and old, men and women, charismati.es and non-charismatics. Over half of the workers were national Christians from the Philippines. There were people from six different countries and from a number of different Christian organizations working together to share Christ’s love. This is the kind of cooperation needed. The challenge before us is to build new bridges of understanding. We must build a strong bridge of understanding between the younger, rapidly growing churches in the Two-Thirds World countries and the matured and financially blessed churches in the West. We need to build a bridge which brings together the younger generation and the older generation of Christian leaders. While younger leaders are looking for ways to have meaningful involvement in Christian work by horizontal networking, older leaders, used to working with “top-down” authority lines, need to look for creative ways to support the developing gifts of younger leaders. This requires new and creative styles of leadership. We must build a bridge to unite the rapidly growing charismatic movement with the more traditional, forms of Christianity. The one emphasizes the supernatural power of God operating in spiritual gifts and signs and wonders, while the other underscores the Word of God. We need both the power of God and the Word of God. The fourth bridge would bring together with understanding the call of God for both evangelism and social responsibility, sacrificial service in the world and preaching the gospel of Christ to the world, of both word and deed, proclamation and presence. Our goal is to build bridges of understanding during tire next ten days in our national delegation meetings, in the different tracks, over meals, and when we all meet together. The spirit of cooperation we experience in the next ten days could well be a foretaste of the kind of cooperation we will enjoy over the next ten years. In a Rapidly Growing Urbanizing World The world is moving to the cities. In 1900, a little more than one out of ten people were urban dwellers. One hundred years later, in the year 2000, almost eight out of ten will be urban dwellers, according to United Nations statistics. The world is becoming one gigantic city. Moody said, “If we reach the cities we reach the nation. But if we fail in the cities, they will become a cesspool that will infect the entire country.” For all the “human family,” this is an increasingly unfriendly world. Major threats to the earth’s environment drive one hundred species of plants and animals to extinction every day because of the gases from automobiles, factories and power plants, toxic and household waste, and overpopulation. One out of every five people in the world go to bed hungry every night. It is also an increasingly unfriendly world for Christians. In the year 1900, virtually every country was open to expatriate missionaries of one tradition or another. This is no longer true. Major changes are taking place in the ability of expatriate missionaries, particularly from the West, to move into unreached areas. By the year 2000, at present trends, over eight out of ten people of the world will be living in countries with restricted access to traditional missionaries. In an Attitude of Dependence It is Jesus who is Lord. It was Jesus who said: “All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. Therefore go. And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age” (Matthew 28:18-20). “The horse is made ready for the day of battle, but victory rests with the Lord” (Proverbs 21:3.1). It is the Holy Spirit who empowers the church. We have experienced three mighty waves of worldwide Pentecostal/charismatic renewal in this century. There is a fourth wave of those of us who desire to hear what the Spirit is saying to the churches through these other waves and join them in the task of spreading the kingdom of God throughout the earth to the year 2000 and until he comes. To Mobilize the Body of Christ There is a shift in the center of gravity in Christianity from the West to the East and from the North to tire South. This growing, global church is becoming mobilized for world evangelization. As John Stott wrote in his commentary on the Lausanne Covenant, “Unless the whole church is mobilized, the whole world is not likely to be reached.” In the Lausanne Covenant, embedded within fourteen other affirmations, one stands out like a precious jewel because it is the only article which speaks of rejoicing. It is article 8, titled “Churches in Evangelistic Partnership,” which begins: “We rejoice that a new missionary era has dawned.” The dawn of partnership with missions movements around the world has become at least mid-morning of a new day in Christianity—a day in which the responsibility for world evangelization is being taken up by the “whole body of Christ.” More Christians from more countries are seeking to fulfill the Great Commission than at any time in history. The internationalization of missions is the great new fact of our time. Our challenge is to encourage the new world-evangelization initiatives from Africa, Asia, and Latin America, which at the present rate will place more than one hundred thousand missionaries in the field by the year 2000. But not only that, we are challenged by the need to unleash all the forces within the church in this mobilization. Particularly, we need to see women, young people, and laypeople within our churches renewed, moved into action, and growing as they discover and fulfill their role in world evangelization. Andrew described to me the tremendous ministry a single laywoman had at the Manila dump over the years. I was also impressed that a man as young as Andrew had such compassion and vision. When we got to the top of the dump and saw those children bent over, picking up garbage, he said two things that I will never forget, “These are beautiful people,” And then he added, “It is a privilege to work here.” How much he was like Andrew, the brother of Peter, who kept on bringing people to Jesus. And this Andrew was only twenty-one years old. We need to give the youth of our generation room to grow, and even allow them to make mistakes, and release them in ministry along with other people. All these vital forces need to be released in order to achieve our goal. To Fulfill the Great Commission This means going beyond “near neighbor” evangelism. This means we need to take the gospel cross-culturally to those groups of unreached people who have never had an adequate internal witness. Cross-cultural evangelism to the unreached is our highest priority. These people groups have never had an indigenous church movement in their midst. This point was highlighted at Lausanne I. Fifteen years ago there were an estimated seventeen thousand unreached people groups, defined by dialect and sub-culture which needed to be reached. Today, that number has been reduced to some twelve thousand. Most of these people groups live in a belt that extends from West Africa across Asia, between ten degrees north of the equator to forty degrees north of the equator. This includes the great Muslim block, the Hindu block, and the Buddhist block. And today only seven of every one hundred missionaries are working among these peoples. We must refocus our efforts in evangelization. We must redeploy our missionaries We must think of new creative ways of partnership. And we must not forget the neec for the re-evangelization of Europe. To Obey the Great Commandment A recent study indicated that a great deal of the tost are poor and a great deal of the poor are lost. It also became evident that those in greatest need are living in the mids’ of Muslim contexts in the Third World. By the year 2000, one out of every four people will be urban poor. Our challenge is incamational missions—to respond to the needs of the whole person as we proclairr new life in Christ. Andrew and his team have learned to minister to the whole person. There is a foot program for the children under five living in the community. Many of the workers art trained in primary health care and lovingly minister to the sick and suffering. While i was there they were preparing a room that was to be used as a Christian preschool. Until He Comes As Christians approach the end of this century, many groups within the worldwide body of Christ are setting the year 2000 as a symbolic milestone for humankind. This milestone year serves both as a focal point for evangelization plans and as a transitior time into a new century of world evangelization. Several countries, including the Philippines, already have a “2000 Plan” ant national A.D. 2000 task forces. Others, like Costa Rica in Central America, have already planned their meetings. They are expecting over one thousand Christian leaders in Sar Jose, Costa Rica in August for what they have called Alcance 2000, “reaching out to the year 2000.” Other remarkable national initiatives are taking place. There will be time during thi; Congress for delegations to come together and discuss what can be done in their counfr) as we approach the year 2000 and beyond. Preliminary rough-draft plans setting goals by the year 2000 are being laid out anc considered by leaders in the continents of Southeast Asia, South Asia, Africa, Latir America, the Middle East, and North America. The challenge at this Congress is to see those plans mature and expand so ever; country and continent will have aggressive faith goals for the last ten years of this centur; and millennium. As you gather in your national meetings, begin to think of the mandate of Scripture the context and the issues facing the church in your country, the unreached people groups, the great cities, and the twenty-five most unevangelized countries that youi national church can reach. And seek to answer the question: What can be done by thi year 2000? Set a date for yourself—December 31,1999. Prepare to involve the wide: Christian constituency from your country. Over the next three years, we would like tc see 150 countries have national consultations to set faith goals and discover national strategies. There are also local and global plans focused on the year 2000 by Christiar organizations, local churches, denominations, Christian movements, and affinity groups. The challenge before us is to set significant goals. Ten year goals can become steps of faith that take us from present limitations to future possibilities—-goals that are specific, measurable, and achievable. Let us trust God together to do great things. At the Manila dump community, I also observed signs of joy and peace in the midst of all the agony. Children could be seen playing soccer on the dirt streets and were laughing. An older woman with abig smile came up and gave Andrew a loving embrace. I also learned something as I heard from others outside of the team. The community had gone through a transformation over the previous two years. Signs of the presence of God among his people were everywhere: in the fourteen home Bible studies, in the church filled with children at mid-morning, and throughout the community as Christians became salt and light. Brothers and sisters in Christ, if it can be done in a dump community, then why can we not strive to proclaim the whole gospel to the whole world with the whole church by the year 2000 and until he comes?

    "title": "Great Commission Manifesto",
    "content": "Great Commission Manifesto January 8, 1989 Singapore We, the 314 participants from 50 nations gathered for the Global Consultation for World Evangelization by AD 2000 and Beyond, come from many different churches, denominations and ministries under the direction of the Holy Spirit for what we consider to be a singular moment in the history of the Church. We identify ourselves as a gathering of Christians who by faith alone has accepted Jesus Christ, true God and true man, revealed in the infallible and holy Scriptures as our Lord and Savior. We are committed to biblical righteousness in our behavior and to growth in holiness. We gratefully acknowledge the worldwide witness and ministry of faithful men and women throughout the previous 20 centuries. We humbly confess our pride, prejudice, competition and disobedience that have hindered our generation from effectively working at the task of world evangelization. These sins have impeded God&#39;s desire to spread abroad His gracious provision of eternal salvation through the precious blood of His Son, Jesus Christ. We turn from these sins and failures to express our belief that God has graciously opened to us a window of opportunity to completing the magnificent task He has given us. We boldly seize this crucial moment, more impressed with God&#39;s great power than any force arrayed against us. Cooperation &amp; Partnership We have listened to each other and rejoice at what God is doing through many plans for world evangelization. We learned that there are over 2,000 separate plans relating to world evangelization. We see afresh that cooperation and partnership are absolute necessities if the Great Commission is going to be fulfilled by the Year 2000. For the sake of those who are lost and eternally separated from God, we have dared to pray and dream of what might happen if appropriate autonomy of churches and ministries could be balanced with significant partnership. Empowerment We acknowledge that the evangelization of the world can be carried out only in the power of the Holy Spirit. Listening and ready, we declare our dependence upon the Holy Spirit and commit to undergird all efforts for world evangelization with personal and corporate prayer. We recognize that human energy cannot replace divine activity nor can spiritual success be measured in terms of human achievement. The effectiveness of our endeavors does not lie in human expertise but in the sovereign activity of the Holy Spirit. Compassion The Good News of Jesus Christ brings special meaning to suffering humanity. God&#39;s love brings hope to those who live under the bondage of sin, and who are victims of poverty and injustice. We believe that Christians involved in world evangelization should live among people as servants and minister to the needs of the whole person. Towards Fulfillment The revelation of God in Christ is plain. The commission to His Church is clear. The unfinished task is apparent. The opportunity to work together is ours. We believe that it is possible to bring the Gospel to all people by the year 2000. This can be accomplished with sufficient dedication, unity, and mobilization of available resources, powered and directed by God. We believe that it is possible to being the Gospel to all people by the year 2000. This can be accomplished with sufficient dedication, unity, and mobilization of available resources, powered and directed by God. To accomplish this objective, it will be necessary to: Focus particularly on those who have not yet heard the Gospel. Provide every people and population on earth with a valid opportunity to hear the Gospel in a language they can understand. it is our fervent prayer that at least half of humanity will profess allegiance to the Lord Jesus. Establish a mission-minded church planting movement within every unreached people group so that the Gospel is accessible to all people. Establish a Christian community of worship, instruction in the word, healing, fellowship. prayer, disciple making, evangelism, and missionary concern in every human community.

    "title": "GCOWE 1989 Pressing Forward to AD 2000",
    "content": "Pressing Forward to AD 2000 Darrell Dorr With a flurry of new materials and a last-minute surprise, a global consultation advances the frontier missions movement Expectations were high as 314 mission leaders from 50 countries descended on Singapore’s Amara Hotel during the first week of 1989. But if these participants in the Global Consultation on World Evangelization by AD 2000 and Beyond had high hopes, it was because consultation organizers and promoters had set the pace. David Barrett, editor of the World Christian Encyclopedia and Anglican missions researcher, had heralded the momentum leading up to the consultation as an accelerating “global evangelization movement.” Panya Baba, director of the Evangelical Missionary Society in Nigeria and a member of the consultation’s program committee, declared, “What we are witnessing today as the AD 2000 plans start to work together is not an accident. It is the plan of the Holy Spirit.” And Ralph Winter, director of the U.S. Center for World Mission, had written, “Why would I call this the ‘meeting of the century’? Simple. Never before has so broadly-backed a global meeting of mission strategists been proposed for the single purpose of evaluating what could be done specifically by the end of this century—with both the hope and confidence that the task can be finished.” But could GCOWE 2000 live up to such high expectations? By the end of the January 5-8 gathering, answers were mixed. Participants had exchanged a great deal of information, strengthened working relationships, and issued a stirring “Great Commission Manifesto.” But the consultation wavered at several key junctures, and only a last-minute initiative from the floor ensured the creation of an ongoing information office. Reasons for Optimism There seemed to be ample reasons for the wave of optimism undergirding the consultation. First, support for GCOWE 2000 mushroomed after an ad hoc steering committee, chaired by Thomas Wang, international director of the Lausanne Committee for World Evangelization, conceived the consultation in May 1988. Second, as invitations were sent to representatives of AD 2000 plans and other leaders of “Great Commission networks,” positive responses came from across the spectrum of Christianity. Participants included Anglicans, Baptists, Catholics, Charismatics, Lutherans, Methodists, Presbyterians, and Pentecostals. Also represented were the Lausanne Committee, Campus Crusade for Christ, World Vision International, Third World Mission Advance, and 180 other organizations. More than half of the participants came from the non-Western world. Third, a flurry of new, exciting books and working documents—promising to “turn heads from Nairobi to New York,” according to Jay Gary, consultation director—came off the press as reference materials for GCOWE. Participants received some of these in the Christmas mail and others only after arriving in Singapore. Books included: Seven Hundred Plans to Evangelize the World: The Rise of a Global Evangelization Movement, by David Barrett and James Reapsome; Countdown 1900: World Evangelization at the End of the Nineteenth Century, by Todd Johnson; and Towards AD 2000 and Beyond: A Reader, edited by Luis Bush, Jay Gary, and Mike Roberts. Two other documents heightened anticipation: “Two Thousand Plans Toward AD 2000: a Kaleidoscopic Global Plan to See the World Evangelized by AD 2000 and Beyond,” prepared by a 15-member task force directed by Barrett; and “AD 2000 Global Goals: A Selection of 168 Proposed Great Commission Goals.” A Call for Unprecedented Cooperation The common theme in these documents—a plea that Christians from many backgrounds recognize each others’ initiatives, build upon them in a new level of cooperation and coordination, and shun a “standalone, self-sufficient” posture—was also the driving force behind the consultation itself. Organizers hoped to foster networking and peer reviews, prevent unnecessary duplication, lay the foundation for subsequent national and regional consultations, and promote the development of “Biblical, measurable, and strategic” AD 2000 goals. Pre-consultation literature eloquently spoke of the need to appropriate the “corporate giftedness” of the global Church and to give special emphasis to unreached peoples and other unevangelized populations. A December 5 cover letter characterized the “kaleidoscopic global plan” as “a collective action plan for the next 24 months or so for those committed to achieving ‘something beautiful for God’ by AD 2000.” 72 Hours Packed With Activity These aspirations were fanned by Thomas Wang’s opening address on January 5. Reminding participants of the few years remaining before AD 2000 and the brevity of the 72 hours of the consultation, Wang declared, “God is ringing a bell in heaven. Time is up pretty soon. It’s time to get serious.” Decrying parochial “turf-ism,” he added, “The next chapter of church history has not yet been written. How it gets written depends very much upon what we do, or fail to do, today.” In response, participants plunged into a series of presentations and discussions during the next three days: Six case studies of AD 2000 plans were put forward to shed light on the consultation’s working documents and suggest lessons that could be applied in other contexts. Plans described included: Hong Kong 2000, a national plan; The World By 2000 (international radio); AD 2000 Together (Pentecostal/charismatic); New Life 2000 (Campus Crusade for Christ); Evangelization 2000 (Catholic); and Bold Mission Thrust (Southern Baptist). Following each presentation, participants discussed the plan’s strengths, weaknesses, and transferable concepts. Continental meetings allowed participants to identify national and regional AD 2000 goals and prayer strategies. Study was also made of a proposal for a series of interlocking national, regional, and international AD 2000 consultations in the 1990s. These sessions were intended to help participants see their respective countries as both mission fields and mission bases. A task force led by Floyd McClung, international director of Youth With A Mission and a member of the GCOWE program committee, worked through four drafts of a “Great Commission Manifesto.” The Manifesto, intended to summarize the spirit and intention of the consultation for the benefit of the general public, was presented to participants at the concluding session and unanimously affirmed. Four basic goals were highlighted in the Manifesto: Focus particularly on those who have not yet heard the gospel. Provide every people and population on earth with a valid opportunity to hear the gospel in a language they can understand. It is our fervent prayer that at least half of humanity will profess allegiance to the Lord Jesus. Establish a mission-minded church-planting movement within every unreached people group so that the gospel is accessible to all people. Establish a Christian community of worship, instruction in the word, healing, fellowship, prayer, disciple making, evangelism and missionary concern in every human community.” Sprinkled throughout these multiple tracks were plenary addresses from members of the program committee. Under the theme of “Dreaming,” Bill O’Brien, executive vice-president of the Southern Baptist Foreign Mission Board, eloquently portrayed the scenario of a worldwide celebration in AD 2000 to rejoice in the fulfillment of the Great Commission. He asked, “Dare we dream together? Dare we think this group assembled could take some corporate action that might affect the destiny of the world?” Floyd McClung, addressing the theme of “Targeting,” declared, “It is essential to focus our efforts to reach those who have never heard the gospel. This is especially true of the Muslim, Buddhist, and Hindu worlds but also includes those peoples that must be re-evangelized. Special focus must be given to world-class cities and the least-evangelized nations of the world.” And Luis Bush, president of Partners International and director of the 1987 COMIBAM missions congress for Latin America, covered the theme of “Fulfilling” by enthusing over the “streams” of faith and obedience now flooding the earth: “God’s people are in motion. They are moving. They are being mobilized, and all of a sudden we see potential for the completion of the Great Commission.” The Big-Picture Plan But it was the “kaleidoscopic” or “big-picture” global plan that was the heart of GCOWE deliberations. Fifty pages long, this working document contained 104 innovative “action points,” grouped under 29 categories, that Barrett and his editorial task force put forward as a blueprint for collaboration. Proposals in the plan ranged from developing systems to match evangelizers and unreached peoples and beginning a new global order of itinerant evangelists to creating a worldwide electronic communications network and a catalogue of necessary resources. Central to the plan was its advocacy of a full-time AD 2000 Global Task Force, a team of people focusing on continuing research, publications, and consultations and ensuring that individual agencies take responsibility for one or more action steps. The document presupposed both existing AD 2000 plans and the necessity for “all the background things Christians already know to be necessary.” In three separate sessions, GCOWE participants met in small working groups to review and revise the big-picture plan. They generated 300 pages of suggestions for Barrett and his task force to consider, and a number indicated their willingness to help implement one or more of the 104 action points. But the big-picture plan generated tension as well as excitement. A minority of participants expressed concerns that the plan could be perceived as top-down, ignoring grassroots input, that its theological base and spiritual emphasis needed strengthening, and that it was too detailed to be effectively communicated to their constituencies. In a “review and clarification” statement issued the final day of the consultation, the GCOWE steering committee switched gears and characterized the kaleidoscopic plan, not as a collective action plan, but as something that “would become part of our ongoing ‘tool boxes,’ challenging our thinking and helping equip us in decision-making.” Fracas in the Family Soon other points of tension began to emerge. Latin American participants, in a “statement of concern” about Roman Catholic participation in the consultation, said “the religious-political force of the Roman Catholic Church is using all means available and is in fact the most fierce opponent to all evangelistic efforts on our part.” Only a half dozen Catholics were present at GCOWE 2000, but the Latins protested the inclusion of the Evangelization 2000 plan as a featured case study and declared that cooperation with Catholics “goes beyond our historical and biblical commitment.” Gino Henriques, a Catholic priest from India who presented the Evangelization 2000 case study, responded by saying, “For whatever hurts they have received from Catholics, I’m not only grieved but I would beg pardon for those hurts, and I love them in the Lord.” A moving moment in the consultation came when Southern Baptist Foreign Mission Board president Keith Parks, due to follow Henriques on the program, first brought the priest back to the lectern and publicly acknowledged him as a brother in Christ. Another group of participants, noting the prominence of the proposed Global AD 2000 Task Force within the big-picture plan, voiced their concern that GCOWE 2000 not create an additional structure that might duplicate the roles of the Lausanne Committee or the World Evangelical Fellowship. Others responded that they felt the need for a movement, like GCOWE, that is broader and more inclusive than either Lausanne or WEF. Thomas Wang, as director of the Lausanne and chairman of GCOWE 2000, had earlier stated his own opinion that whatever happened at Singapore would enrich Lausanne II, where an AD 2000 emphasis is scheduled to constitute one of 20 “tracks.” Many participants, while intellectually stimulated and spiritually challenged by the many reference materials, also began to suffer from bad cases of information overload. One leader confessed in a small group session, “After awhile, I just gave up trying to digest all the material and began to focus instead on getting to know the brothers and sisters around me.” As if to acknowledge the torrent of paper, the consultation’s first daily newsletter featured an article entitled, “How Am I Supposed to Read All This Stuff?” The steering committee acknowledged procedural shortfalls and attributed many to the hasty preparations for the gathering. Getting the Numbers Straight Meanwhile, in an eddy off the main current of consultation proceedings, a small group of prominent mission researchers were meeting to clarify technical definitions and statistical estimates of the unfinished task in world evangelization. Weeks earlier, David Barrett had pulled together a GCOWE 2000 task force of researchers to seek unanimity in defining the job to be done. Barrett’s success in catalyzing helpful discussion prompted Thomas Wang to appointed him chairman of a similar task force commissioned to achieve new consensus among mission researchers in time for the July 1989 “Lausanne II” congress in Manila. GCOWE 2000 thus provided a convenient forum for the results of the first task force to be presented in rough draft and for a few members of the second, Lausanne-related task force to begin to meet. In addition to Barrett, members of the LCWE task force present at GCOWE 2000 included Ed Dayton of the Missions Advanced Research and Communications Center, Ralph Winter of the U.S. Center for World Mission, and Bob Waymire of Global Mapping International. Other members, including Patrick Johnstone, author of the well-known Operation World manual, were absent. The view of the unfinished task on which GCOWE 2000 itself was based was largely the result of Barrett’s own work. He has divided the world into 15,000 population segments (including 11,500 ethnolinguistic peoples) and estimated that approximately 3030 of these segments (including 2000 peoples) are unevangelized. Other researchers have partitioned the world differently, often with different emphases in view. Winter, for example, leaning on terms developed in a 1982 Lausanne-sponsored huddle, has preferred to focus on the task of planting church movements among people groups where no such movements exist, and has popularized the view that approximately 16,000 peoples are unreached by this definition. Working under a heightened sense of both external pressure—represented by Lausanne II and public confusion—and internal constraints—represented by the momentum generated by GCOWE, the task force began to probe each other’s ethnographic, missiological, and statistical assumptions with greater depth than they had in previous, isolated, relatively sporadic conversations. They agreed to consult with each other more often and to work more vigorously at presenting a united front in the preparation of materials. A Global Task Force? As participants approached the final day of GCOWE 2000, attention was focused on the question of whether the steering committee would continue to press for an ongoing Global Task Force. About 85% of the respondents to a continuation questionnaire had indicated their support for the Task Force, but a vocal minority had expressed either reservations or opposition. In the afternoon prior to the closing session, the steering committee met for a final time to consider continuation. Weary from criticisms of the consultation’s procedural shortfalls, committee members were also buffeted by conflicting concerns that the prospective Task Force would be too inclusive, exclusive, or competitive with existing bodies. Mindful in prayer that “unless a kernel of wheat fall to the ground and dies, it remains only a single seed,” and confident that the Holy Spirit would foster an AD 2000 movement in His own way, they decided to not press for a continuation structure. Floyd McClung later explained, “We sensed that the Lord was not calling us to a new structure but instead a new sense of servanthood to one another. We experienced a tremendous sense of joy as we placed this in the Lord’s hands.” One Surprise Follows Another Unaware of this progression of events, participants gathered for the closing evening session. Following the hearty approval of the Great Commission Manifesto, Thomas Wang came to the lectern and announced the steering committee’s decision to dissolve itself and not present a proposal for continuation. McClung took the microphone, added a few explanatory comments, and then led the gathering into a time of worship. Participants were still musing on the unexpected turn of events when McClung began to give the benediction. Was it really over, just like that, after all had been said and done? But then, just as participants were preparing to leave, McClung acknowledged a written request from Ralph Winter to address the gathering. Winter expressed gratitude for the steering committee’s humility and sensitivity, noting that participants who favored a continuation office ought not to run roughshod over the minority who disapproved. But he added, “There should be Christian freedom if some of us here want to get together to encourage and fund a simple, meek-and-mild information office to help us more efficiently help one another.” He then suggested that those interested in such an office gather at the front of the room a few minutes after the final session concluded. About 85 participants did so, and after an hour-long discussion agreed to establish an information office to be staffed by Jay and Olgy Gary, who had served GCOWE 2000 from its inception as project coordinators. Four other guidelines were developed for the “AD 2000 Global Service Office”: The office will be accountable to an advisory committee comprised of as many members of the GCOWE steering committee as are able to serve, plus additional members as the committee sees the need; Financial support will come from as many agencies as continue to believe in the office’s importance and are able to contribute. The office will assist, as requested by the Lausanne Committee, in preparations for the AD 2000 track of the “Lausanne II” congress in Manila. The office will undergo a review of mandate and performance after 6-9 months. Participants in this post-GCOWE discussion agreed to avoid any claim that their initiative is an official result of GCOWE 2000 and to honor the steps taken by leaders and participants at the consultation. Furthermore, Bill O’Brien and Jim Montgomery—two members of the GCOWE steering committee—pointed out that this new form of “ad hoc-ery” supported, not contradicted, the steering committee’s action because it validated the committee’s rationale that it was free to yield the AD 2000 movement as something the Holy Spirit would forward in His own way. The AD 2000 Global Service Office In the weeks since GCOWE 2000, the Global Service Office has taken its initial steps. A working committee—consisting of former GCOWE program committee members—is in place, a larger advisory committee has begun to take shape, and plans are in motion for a separate editorial committee for an AD 2000 Monitor newsletter. Gary has stated his intention to primarily network with agencies with AD 2000 plans, mission associations, media ministries, and foundations. He is now completing work on the GCOWE 2000 compendium, due to appear in early April. The compendium will contain not only edited transcripts of GCOWE 2000 addresses but also Gary’s first-person account of the progression of events before, during, and after the consultation. Evaluating the Consultation So how to evaluate GCOWE 2000? Did it fulfill expectations? For many, yes; for others, no. The meeting of the century? It’s still too early to say. The consultation was hastily organized, and participants received reference materials too late to properly digest and act upon them. The 72 hours of the event were filled with more agendas and expectations than they could reasonably contain. Diversity brought breadth of perspective, but also reduced many decisions to the level of the least common denominator. Rigorous peer review and development of a collective, roll-up-the-sleeves action plan—eagerly anticipated before the consultation—gave way to a cordial but relatively indiscriminate affirmation of one another and an agreement to keep talking. Comparisons to 1888 Ironically, while frequently citing Todd Johnson’s Countdown to 1900 as a key reference tool, leaders and participants at GCOWE 2000 nevertheless repeated some of the same shortcomings the book chronicles. Following GCOWE 2000, Johnson, himself a participant at the consultation and a member of the task force behind the formation of the big-picture plan, lamented the consultation’s lack of a “sense of urgency.” Prominent within Countdown to 1900 is an assessment of a major conference in London in 1888, a conference remarkably similar to GCOWE 2000 in its scope, ambition, and results. Johnson describes the 1888 conference in this way: “Because it was so hastily organized and because so many speakers were on the platform, there was no opportunity for genuine strategic planning. ‘Dividing up the world’ was pushed aside as the delegates tended to focus on what was being done and not on what remained to be done. [A.T.] Pierson’s rallying cry fell on an auditorium of men and women just learning to listen to each another, not on Christians ready to plan the final conquest of the world.” In another passage in his book, Johnson cites another assessment of the London conference by a leading periodical of the day. This assessment, too, could well apply to GCOWE 2000: “They ‘were of one mind and one soul’ in desire and purpose, to ‘preach the gospel to every creature.’ How best this could be done was the dominant thought. Much information was given. Difficulties and obstacles were stated with great candour. Many statements were made of a most encouraging and stimulating character. “But the meetings were deliberative, not executive. Therefore it was that many questions of great practical and doctrinal interest were hardly touched, and others were ventilated only, not decided. The conference was not a council, and was too large, miscellaneous and popular to develop into true practical deliberative forms, or to elicit much boldness of speech or freedom of opinion. This, no doubt, was felt by many to be a want, but it was inevitable.” Looking on the Bright Side But GCOWE 2000 was at least not “large, miscellaneous and popular,” and whereas the 1888 gathering featured too many platform speakers and had no continuation structure to show for its efforts, GCOWE safeguarded time for working groups and informal networking and also resulted, though circuitously, in an ongoing information office that can maintain momentum toward the year 2000. And that’s just the beginning of the consultation’s list of achievements. Jay Gary points out that GCOWE gave international identity to the AD 2000 movement: “We’ve entered a new era of Great Commission Christians talking and journeying together. Many of the groups present at the consultation—such as the Assemblies of God, the Southern Baptists, Campus Crusade for Christ, and Wycliffe Bible Translators—were represented by their top leaders. These organizations are big enough to go their own way, but they’ve chosen not to.” Other fruits of the consultation include: A remarkable new set of reference tools—“concise, prophetic, accurate documentation,” in Gary’s words, and a new emphasis on cooperative AD 2000 goal-setting. Enthusiasm for subsequent national and regional AD 2000 consultations and other initiatives. Heightened awareness of the “window of opportunity” the Church must appropriate in the next 2-3 years if it is to seriously pursue any set of AD 2000 goals. While the consultation itself may have been characterized by hesitancy at several points, participants have returned home with new sensitivity to the calendar. New momentum for such crucial projects as the proposed “Adopt-a-People” clearinghouse, long discussed but only now receiving the attention it deserves. Plenary addresses and informal conversations in Singapore generated support for the March 15-17 Adopt-a-People symposium at the U.S. Center for World Mission. And prior to the consultation, about 30 U.S. participants agreed in advance that a worthy goal would be to press for each unreached people to be adopted in a church-mission partnership by 1991. Additional breezes in the sails of the new Lausanne Statistical Task Force as it seeks to further cooperative mission research. Already clear is the fact that Barrett has recently discovered far greater linguistic diversity in certain areas of the world than has been published earlier. Among other things, this discovery has lent new credence to Winter’s estimate of 16,000 people groups remaining to be reached. A statistical picture of unprecedented scope is expected to appear in the next few weeks. A mechanism for coordinated preparations for the AD 2000 track at “Lausanne II” in Manila this July. u Impact on a wide range of additional gatherings scheduled to occur within the next 2-3 years. For example, on the heels of GCOWE 2000, the North American Renewal Service Committee met in Orlando, Florida January 16-17 and decided on an AD 2000 focus for its August 1990 Congress on the Holy Spirit and World Evangelization. The committee represents Pentecostal denominations and renewal movements in Catholic and mainline Protestant churches, and the congress is expected to draw 50,000 people to the Hoosierdome in Indianapolis. Vinson Synan, chairman of the Renewal Service Committee, says of GCOWE 2000, “This Consultation was truly an historic moment for the Church. Churches and ministries that had never talked together pledged cooperation in completing the task of world evangelization by the end of the century.... The vision, data, and resources shared in Singapore will set the agenda for the Church until the end of the century.” Jay Gary concedes, “Those closest to the consultation raised expectations which were perhaps unrealistic.” But consultation organizers and participants can be forgiven if rhetoric outpaced reality in this instance. For, like a group of mountain climbers who, bruised and weary, fail to reach the pinnacle on the first attempt, they at least attained a new plateau. Base camp is now at a higher altitude, and the summit waits for those who are able and willing to try again before night comes and the window of opportunity is lost.

The “Kaleidoscopic” Global Plan: A Summary A central topic of discussion at GCOWE 2000 was the 50-page “kaleidoscopic global plan” drafted before the consultation by a 15-member working group led by David Barrett. The document’s 104 “action points,” grouped under 29 major headings (see below), were “designed to help Christians to definitively overcome various crucial problems, most of which have each sunk a number of world evangelization plans in the past.” Working groups at GCOWE 2000 hashed over each category of proposals and generated 300 pages of suggested revisions for Barrett and his colleagues to consider. Responsibility: Proclaim human responsibility to obey Jesus’ Great Commission. Present Status: Acknowledge that current global progress in evangelization is inadequate. A New Start: Begin by acknowledging the existence of 2,000 global and local plans. Definitions: Spread new, exciting definitions of key terms: “Great Commission”, “Evangelization”, etc. Socio-political Concern: Monitor and measure the world’s status and related ministries. The Unfinished Task: Circulate a detailed survey of unevangelized populations. Great Commission Christians: Recognize their massive presence among 9,000 peoples. Great Commission Global Plans: Build on today’s 387 current global plans. Multichanneling: Foster a parallel but cooperative approach among the world’s global plans. Goals: Compile all global AD 2000 goals and monitor their progress. Scenarios: Draw out the implications of alternate scenarios for AD 2000 and Beyond. Failures: Warn AD 2000 promoters that one possible scenario is total failure. Modifications: Encourage sponsors of global plans to change and combine these plans as needed. New Plans: Suggest that upcoming or incipient plans support our big-picture plan. Resources: Catalogue all Christian resources and list who benefits from them. Redistribution: Press for the redistribution of more resources towards the unevangelized world. Redeployment: Motivate missionaries to redeploy to unevangelized populations. Innovations: Generate a continuous stream of new ideas, methods, and publications. Engagement: Advise agencies how to engage new target populations. Segmentization: Match up workers with all unevangelized population segments. Nonresidential Mission: Help agencies develop ministry options to unevangelized populations. Itineration: Inaugurate a new global order of itinerant Spirit-led evangelists. Computers: Establish electronic communications between Great Commission agencies. Logistics: Facilitate logistics of new forms of cooperative global mission. Programs: Aid national and regional task forces and consultations. Prioritization: Assist agencies to prioritize programs and possible ministries. Administration: Ask agencies to each implement one or two points of this overall collective plan. Materials: Produce primary data, diagrams, and releases and disseminate them widely. The Great Commission World 4,000 mission sending agencies 56 global ministries 9 global mega-networks 262,300 foreign missionaries $8 billion/year to foreign missions 788 global plans since AD 30 387 global plans now in existence 254 of these plans making progress 1600 nonglobal AD 2000 plans 400 conferences a year 1,300 citywide evangelistic campaigns each year 10,000 articles/books each year 42 million computers AD 2000 Plans Throughout history, at least 788 global plans have emerged to evangelize the world. These plans have sprung from every continent and every major tradition of Christianity. More than 1/2 of history as plans have emerged since 1948. By 1988, one new plan appeared each week, of which 31% were from the Two-Thirds world. About 254 global plans are active today and making progress, and 1/2 have target dates for AD 2000. Of these, 89 spend more than $10 million a year. Of these, 33 spend more than $100 million a year. Between now and the year 2000, $40 billion will be spent on these plans.

    "content": "Luz Para Las Naciones COMBAM Brasil A Cooperação Missionária Ibero-americana surgiu do primeiro Congresso Missionário Ibero-americano, realizado em São Paulo, Brasil, em 1987. A Confraternidade Evangélica Latino-americana (CONELA) havia convocado uma reunião de líderes em 1984, no México, para discutir a organização de um congresso internacional com o propósito de promover o desenvolvimento da visão missionária na região. Assim se realizou o COMIBAM 87, onde mais de três mil representantes de todas as nações da América Latina, Espanha e Portugal, além de observadores de outros países, se reuniram para escutar sobre a tarefa missionária global e comprometer-se com a formação de um movimento missionário a partir da Ibero América. Foi naquela ocasião que Luis Bush enfaticamente proclamou: “Em 1918, a América Latina foi declarada um campo de missão. Hoje, em 1987, a América Latina se declara uma força missionária”. A partir desse Primeiro Congresso Missionário Ibero-americano, a COMIBAM Internacional desenvolveu suas relações em âmbito mundial, com outras redes regionais, nacionais e globais, ajudando a estabelecer grupos de trabalho, convocando consultas, produzindo livros em espanhol e português, e iniciando a publicação da revista Eles e Nós. Na edição de 1988 do livro Operação Mundo, Patrick Johnstone reportou um total de 1.314 missionários originários da América Latina. Na edição de 1995, reportou mais de 4.482. Destes últimos, 1.364 estavam atuando fora de seu país e 2.126 estavam envolvidos na obra transcultural. Houve um mover de Deus na igreja de toda a região, fortalecendo movimentos missionários nacionais onde já existiam e fazendo nascer onde ainda não se haviam formado. Alguns países já haviam enviado missionários desde o princípio do século XX e também haviam estabelecido redes nacionais de colaboração missionária, mas a partir do COMIBAM 87 houve um forte despertar para impulsionar a obra missionária transcultural. Para entender sistematicamente este processo, devemos recordar algumas datas-chave do desenvolvimento da COMIBAM e de suas contribuições concretas ao movimento missionário: 1987 – Primeiro Congresso Ibero-americano, em São Paulo, Brasil. Fortalecem-se os esforços de mobilização através de toda a Ibero-américa e surgem sérios compromissos com a obra missionária global; 1991-1992 – São promovidas consultas na área de missões transculturais. Surgem mais centros de treinamento missionário e os já estabelecidos crescem e se fortalecem; 1992 – A estratégia de Adote um Povo (AUP) é divulgada e se estimula que se chegue aos “não alcançados”. Os resultados incluem o estabelecimento de um programa regional de oração, a elaboração de manuais e de materiais sobre AUP e o incremento no número de missionários enviados ao campo; 1994 – Igrejas e agências missionárias se reúnem em uma consulta e exploram as áreas de convergência e não de competição. Define-se um modelo de trabalho que envolva as igrejas, os centros de capacitação e as agências missionárias; 1997 – Realiza-se em Acapulco, México, o Segundo Congresso Missionário Ibero-americano, o COMIBAM 97. Foi uma oportunidade para avaliar e projetar o que é missão, do que ela necessita e quais são os elementos para levá-la a cabo. Como movimento missionário ibero-americano, faz-se uma análise das novas tendências na obra missionária global; 2000 – Realiza-se a Primeira Assembleia Geral da COMIBAM, reunindo mais de 100 líderes da Ibero-América com o fim de estruturar e consolidar o trabalho, formulando uma organização básica e conferindo ênfase nas três redes principais do processo missionário; 2003 – Desenvolve-se em Guadarrama, Espanha, a Primeira Cúpula de Liderança da COMIBAM Internacional, cuja ênfase foi o desenvolvimento de propostas e de estratégias para fortalecer o movimento. 2006 – Em Granada, Espanha, é levado a cabo o Terceiro Congresso Missionário Ibero-americano sob o lema: “Resultados e desafios entre os não alcançados”. A meta foi avaliar o movimento missionário a partir da perspectiva do campo. Reúnem-se mais de 1.800 líderes do movimento e 300 obreiros latino-americanos ativos no campo. Podemos dizer que a COMIBAM Internacional passou por três etapas em seu desenvolvimento: A primeira compreendeu os anos de 1987 a 1995. Rudy Girón, depois do Primeiro Congresso Missionário Ibero-americano, desenvolveu a primeira etapa, que se pode denominar Etapa de Iniciação e Expansão. Nela se trabalhou a estruturação formal da visão missionária na Ibero América. Desenvolvem-se os primeiros processos formais, intencionais e organizados de conscientização e mobilização. Por outro lado, esta foi a era dos “Quixotes” e do levantamento de novos líderes em missões, cuja única ferramenta era a paixão pelos não alcançados. Foi nesta época que a história das missões modernas na Ibero América reconhece o início da cooperação missionária ibero-americana. A segunda etapa compreendeu os anos de 1995 a 2000. David Ruiz tomou o legado do Segundo Congresso Missionário Ibero-americano e iniciou um período que se pode chamar Etapa de Estabilização e Consolidação. A organização e o planejamento definidos ganharam uma alta relevância, tendo como resultado a proposta de modelos de trabalho em redes e a regionalização. A terceira etapa foi dos anos 2001 a 2008. Jesús Londoño e uma equipe de trabalho deram início a um período de fortalecimento e renovação. No ano de 2008, em reuniões da Junta Diretiva com o Comitê Executivo, é elaborada uma proposta de mudança, que marca o início de um processo que levaria a repensar a visão, a estratégia e a estrutura da COMIBAM Internacional. Depois de uma cuidadosa análise da organização, elabora-se a proposta: “Uma nova COMIBAM para uma nova era missionária”. Nela se redefinem as declarações de Visão e Missão da COMIBAM e se propõe uma nova e mais leve estrutura organizacional, que facilitaria, em grande medida, o cumprimento da tarefa. Na IV Assembleia Geral da COMIBAM, realizada em outubro de 2009 em Bogotá, Colômbia, a proposta é oficialmente aprovada. Ao longo desses anos, a COMIBAM Internacional tem sido um espaço para o encontro dos movimentos missionários nacionais da região, para a formulação de estratégias e para a relação e colaboração com a comunidade missionária global. Temos nos dedicado a apoiar e a servir a comunidade missionária ibero-americana. Buscamos estar atentos às mudanças e às novas oportunidades no contexto missionário global, servindo como ponte entre as entidades de nossa região e as de outras regiões do mundo. Hoje, devemos dizer que, pela graça soberana de Deus, COMIBAM Internacional tem cumprido sua missão e segue dedicada à sua visão, missão e valores.

    "title": "COMIBAM '87 Ponencia: Sueña Grandes Sueños",
    "content": "Sueña Grandes Sueños Luis Palau ¡Cuán grandes la vision de tu vida! ¡Alguna vez has pensado en lo que Dios podría hacer en tu generación a través de ti! Hay cuatro premisas que creo que son claves en la vida de todo cristiano. Han sido claves en mi vida y por eso quiero compartirlas: Sueña grandes sueños. Planea grandes planes. Ora grandes oraciones. Obedece los grandes mandamientos de Dias. 1. Sueña grandes sueños Cuando tenía unos 17 arios y habrá comenzado a dar la importancia debida a la Palabra de Dios, un versículo en la Biblia comenzó a incomodarme. Me resultaba difícil aceptar esa verdad. incluso me tome el trabajo de compararlo con otras traducciones para versi podrá encontrar una mejor interpretación. Sin embargo, en cada versión las palabras eran esencialmente las mismas. Jesucristo declara: &quot;El que cree en mí, las obras que yo hago, también en las hará; y aun hará mayores que estas, porque yo voy al Padre&quot; (Juan 14:12). Es una promesa magnífica, casi increíble, pero veras. Es una promesa hecha por el mismo Señor Jesus y por lo tanto es segura. ¿La has experimentado en tu vida? Puedo recordar que frustrado me sentí cuando muchacho, pensando en la evangelización de los no-cristianos. Así que con varios de mis amigos empezamos a orar juntas. Y lentamente en mi corazón y en el corazón de los otros comenzó a crecer una visión. Era la visión de ganar a miles para Cristo. Algunos de mis sueños eran tan descabellados que no los comente con nadie más que con mi madre; y ni siquiera con ella los compartí todos. Mama nos alentaba, diciendo: &quot;Vamos, ustedes no necesitan una revelación especial de Dios para ir a alcanzar a los perdidos. Hace siglos el dej6 la gran comisión de anunciar las buenas nuevas a todo el mundo. Así que vayan. No se queden esperando más instrucciones: De manera que empezamos a evangelizar lentamente. No puedo sino maravillarme al recordar coma el Señor ha hecho realidad tantos de nuestros grandes sueños. Hoy Cristo te llama a sonar grandes sueños porque todo aquel que cree en Él puede hacer las grandes obras que El hizo. ¿Como puede ser posible? En primer lugar, Dios envió el Espíritu Santo para q y viviera en nosotros, y ahora hace su obra a través de nosotros. En segundo lugar, Cristo condicion6 su promesa. &quot;El que cree en mí, las obras que yo hago, también en las hará.&quot; El Señor nos desafía a tener fe, no necesariamente más fe, sine fe en El. Una fe activa. El estancamiento en la vida cristiana puede aparecer porque hemos dejado de lado los grandes sueños. A ello se suma que hemos dejado de creer en lo que Dios puede hacer. ¡Acaso termina nuestra confianza en el Señor después de creer en el cómo Salvador? ¿Has cesado de ver grandes cosas en tu vida? ¿Qué es lo que limita a Dios aquí en la tierra? ¿Acaso Dios es incapaz de hacer que los corazones de millares se vuelvan a él? ¿Acaso no puede producir un avivamiento en las iglesias, y hacer que las llamas de ese avivamiento se extiendan a todo el continente? Por supuesto que puede hacerlo. Sin embargo, prefiri6 limitar, al menos en parte, su obra: decidi6 limitarla a todo aquello que le confiamos para que haga por medio de nosotros. Me encanta la promesa que encontramos en los Hechos de los Apóstoles: &quot;Vuestros jóvenes verán visiones y vuestros ancianos sonarán sueños&quot; (2:17). Suena, sí, pero no dejes que a tus sueños se los lleve el viento. Hazlos realidad. 2. Planea Grandes Planes. ¿Tienes planes y sueños de lo que Dios podrá hacer a través de tu vida? lo simplemente estas ocupado con las tareas diarias y la rutina de la vida? ¿Estas vegetando, aburrido de ti mismo y aburrido de los demás? El Señor Jesucristo nos desafía a que abandonemos nuestro conformismo nos dice: &quot;A través de mi Espíritu que mora en ustedes podrán hacer cosas aún más grandes que las que yo mismo he hecho.&quot; El no espera que nos sentemos cómodamente todo el da y só1o sonemos sobre lo que podrá suceder para su gloria. Él quiere que hagamos grandes planes para que los grandes sueños se vuelvan realidad. A menudo, varios años después de que una persona entrega su vida a Cristo, duda de Dios en vez de continuar confiando en El para cosas más grandes. Para que Dios vuelva a usarnos, debemos confesar esta incredulidad, diciendo: &quot;Señor Jesus, renueva mi visión de tu poder. Renueva mi confianza en lo que puedes hacer. Renueva mi fe en tus recurses, que son divinos.&quot; Cuando lo hayas hecho, suena y planea otra vez. Dios puso una carga en mi corazón: predicar el evangelio y ganar para El a tanta gente como sea posible. Primera fue la ciudad en donde vivía come muchacho, después la provincia. Luego la Argentina entera, después toda America Latina. Hoy por la gracia de Dios nuestro equipo quiere que todo el mundo escuche la voz de Dios. ¿Y qué de ti? ¿Estas esperando grandes cosas de Dios? ¿Acaso estas dejando pasar oportunidades? Si es verdad que el Señor desea que se predique el evangelio en todas las naciones, entonces no podemos permanecer pasivos. cual fue elsecrete del apóstol Pablo? No era só1o un sonador. También planeo grandes planes y los llev6 a cabo en el poder del Espíritu Santo. Observa que el apóstol uso de la estrategia para llevar a cabo su ministerio. El no creyó que un plan estratégico fuera carnal o indigno. Toda lo contrario. Lo vio como una herramienta para ministrar en forma más efectiva. Suena par un momento. Trata de visualizar los 5000 millones de personas en el mundo y los miles de millones que no han escuchado el evangelio en esta generación. ¿Qué vas a hacer? Trata de determinar coma Dios podría usarte para compartir tu fe en Cristo en el trabajo, en la escuela, en tu vecindario, y aun mas allá. Comienza hacienda planes específicos. 3. Ora Grandes Oraciones. El Señor no nos dice que simplemente sonemos grandes sueños y planeemos grandes planes, sino que agrega: &quot;Y cualquier cosa que pidáis al Padre en mi nombre, la hare, para que el Padre sea glorificado en el Hija. Si pedís alga en mi nombre, yo lo hare&quot; (Juan 14:13,14). Es una formidable promesa. Dios desea que le pidamos. Sin embargo, nos andamos con vueltas y no somos directos con él. Parecería que temiésemos que el Señor se asustara par los grandes pedidos que le hacemos. &quot;Pídeme,&quot; dice el Señor. los que están esperando? Cuando Esteban, mi hijo menor tenía solo 6 años, siempre me pedía cientos de cosas, coma suele suceder con niños de esa edad. Y sus pedidos a veces eran cosas inverosímiles, pero a mí me encantaba que viniera y me hiciera peticiones. Par regla general, si lo que Esteban solicitaba, estaba dentro de mis posibilidades, yo se lo daba. Después de todo es mi hijo. Nuestro Padre Celestial también desea que nos lleguemos a él con nuestras peticiones. Veamos nuevamente que es lo que enfatiza el Señor en Juan 14:13,14. &quot;Cualquier cosa que pidáis al Padre en mi nombre...para que el Padre sea glorificado en el Hija.&quot; Él nos desafía a que utilicemos sus infinitos recurses y pidamos en su nombre cualquier cosa que glorifique a Dios. ¿Acaso no es este nuestro objetivo en la vida? Dios ha continuado contestando muchas oraciones. Oraciones par decisiones importantes, par tremendas necesidades, par seguridad, par personal y par sabiduría. Y las respuestas de Dios a esas oraciones, tanto par cosas grandes coma par cosas pequeñas, han dado coma resultado una fe renovada y en aumento. El Señor conoce nuestros sueños y nuestros planes. No tenemos que convencerlo tratando de venderle nuestra idea para que así nos de lo que pedimos. El simplemente dice: &quot;Pidan!&quot; Sueña, planea, pero ora grandes oraciones. 4. Obedezcan los Grandes Mandamientos. El primer paso en la vida cristiana en confesar que &quot;Jesus es Señor (Rom 10:9). A medida que maduramos en nuestra fe, comprendemos más y mejor quien es Jesus, el Rey de Reyes y Señor de Señores (1 nm. 6:15). Cada paso posterior en la vida cristiana tiene que ver con la obediencia a Jesus coma Señor. El apóstol Juan nos dice: &quot;Y en esto sabemos que hemos llegado a conocerle: si guardamos sus mandamientos (1 Juan 2:3). Hasta el punto de que sepamos y creamos que Jesus es Señor, hasta ese punto le obedeceremos. Bienaventurado el hombre que teme a Jehová, y en sus mandamientosse deleita en gran manera&quot; (SaImo 112:1). El Señor no solamente nos llama a sonar grandes sueños, planear grandes planes y orar grandes oraciones. También nos llama a obedecer sus grandes mandamientos. &quot;Si me amáis guardad mis mandamientos&quot; (Juan 14:15). Y sus mandamientos no son meras sugerencias, sino precisamente grandes mandamientos. Y porque Cristo es Señor de Señores, tiene derecho a dejamos tales mandamientos. Antes de ascender a los cielos, dijo a sus discípulos &quot;Toda autoridad me ha sido dada en el cielo y sobre la tierra. Por tanto, id, y haced discípulos en todas las naciones, bautizándolos en el nombre del Padre, y del Hijo, y del Espíritu Santo; ensenándoles a guardar todas las cosas que os he mandado&quot; (Mateo 28:19-20). Como Señor de señores, nos ha dado esta gran comisión. El Señor no nos ha llamado a la pasividad sino a la acción. Sonemos, hagamos planes, oremos y disfrutemosla emoción de obedecerle,siendo testigos de cómo otros entregan su corazón a Él. Adelante con el Senór. PDF: COMIBAM-87-Plenarias-Luis-Palau.pdf",

    "title": "COMIBAM '87 Ponencia: Luz Para Las Naciones",
    "content": "Luz Para Las Naciones Luis Bush Introducción: En 1916 America Latina fue declarada campo misionero, en 1987 America Latina se declara cuerpo misionero. En 1918 misionerosforáneosse reunieron para consultar la forma de enviar misioneros a America Latina. En 1987 misioneros nacionales se reúnen para consultar sabre coma enviar misioneros desde America Latina. Jesucristo dijo &#39;Vosotros sois la luz del mundo&quot;. Samas llamados para nuestro amo, maestro y Señor para que seamos luz a las naciones del mundo. Este es el lema para COMIBAM 87: &quot;LUZ PARA LAS NACIONES&quot;. Cristóbal Colon, después de navegar varios días, presionado para las marineras de la Nina, la Pinta y la Santa Maria para regresar a España, agoto su denuedo humano. Estaba para volver, cuando en la noche oscura, aparece una luz que le da fe para seguir adelante. Paco después viene el grito que todos esperaban: &quot;¡Tierra! ¡tierra!&quot; Casi 500 años después, el Pueblo de Dios de esos países, miran la luz de la Palabra de Dios y del Espíritu Santo y claman: &quot;¡Las naciones! ¡Las naciones!&quot; En Italia se prepara las Colombiadas y en España Sevilla &#39;92. Este último es para celebrar las 500 arias de enlace Ibero-Latino, con diplomáticos, artistas y comerciantes de los países de la península lbera y de los países latinoamericanos. En COMIBAM &#39;87 anticipamos 500 años y celebramos un encuentro enfocado en un mismo Señor, Jesucristo; una misma fe evangélica cristiana y una misma vision de ser luz para las naciones. En 1493, Cristóbal Colon fue consultado par las poderosas de su dia y resultó la famosa &quot;raya&quot; dibujada sabre un mapa de las Americas. Según ellos, todo lo que estaba al occidente de aquella raya pertenecía a España, y lo del oriente era de Portugal. Hoy, tanto las Hispanos de las Americas come los de habla Portuguesa de Brasil, nos reunimos con las de España y Portugal come un solo cuerpo. Congregados coma Cuerpo de Jesucristo, para consultar sabre como implementar el mandate de Cristo de ser luz a las naciones. ¿No venirnos a COMIBAM para preguntar “si’ o “no”, sine para preguntar Como? cómo hacer para ser luz para las naciones? Señor, reunidos aquí en Sao Paulo, muéstranos tu Palabra, por tu Espíritu y por el consejo de muchos que te aman, como es que podemos cumplir con tu llamado a ser luz para las naciones. Señor, estamos dispuestos. Henos aquí para hacer tu voluntad, a pesar de algunos cambios que tendríamos que hacer. Cambios de actitudes, reordenamiento de nuestras prioridades, ajustes en nuestras actividades eclesiásticas, aunque esto implique cambios en nuestra mentalidad. lsaias 49:1-3, 5-6. Somos llamados a ser luz para las naciones. 1. ¿A Quién está hecho el llamado de ser luz para las naciones? El pasaje en Isaías 49 enfatiza más que nada a quien se dirige el llamamiento de ser luz para las naciones. Es para aquel quien es: llamado desde el vientre, nombrado por el Señor, cubierto con la sombra de su mano, puesto por saeta bruñida, guardado en su aljaba, dicho por Dios: &quot;Misiervo erestú&quot; en quien Dios se gloriará. Dios ha comisionado a su pueblo. Es aquel que él considera ser siervo: &quot;Poco es para mí que tu seas mi siervo&quot; (Is. 49:6). En cada generación Dios entrega la antorcha a aquel pueblo que debe cumplir con su mandate de ser luz para las naciones. En este texto es Israel, pueblo de Dios, siervo de Dios a quien fue entregada la antorcha. &quot;...te di para ser luz para las naciones.&quot; Te di la antorcha encendida. Pero esta antorcha paso de las manos de Israel a Jesucristo, quien admitió ser el siervo profetizado por el mismo Isaías en los capítulos 42 al 57 cuando dijo: &#39;&#39;Yo soy la Luz del mundo&quot;. Luego Cristo entrego aquella antorcha a sus discípulos, diciéndoles: &#39;Vosotros sois la luz del mundo.&quot; &quot;Me seréis testigo en de la tierra.&quot; Jerusalén, en toda Judea, en Samaria y hasta lo ultimo Después, la antorcha fue entregada a la Iglesia del Señor (Hechos 13:47) para que se convirtiera en el Pueblo del Señor, el siervo de lsaias 49:6, dado por Dios a ser luz para las naciones. La antorcha de la iglesia naciente en el media oriente fue pasado a la Iglesia de Europa, y se podría decir que en las últimas 100 alias paso a los norteamericanos. Ahora, desde 1980, el ano en que el número de evangélicos en el tercer mundo fue igual al número de las evangélicos de los países noratlánticos; principio a pasar a los países tercermundistas. Estamos entrando en una nueva era de misiones. Ya el porcentaje de evangélicos en el tercer mundo creció del 50% de todoslos evangélicos en el mundo en · 1980 a 66% en 1985, apenas cinco alias después. El aumento de misioneros de America Latina, África, y Asia surge; rápidamente. A este ritmo de crecimiento, en el año 2000 · serán 67,000 misioneros de los países Asiáticos, sin contar los de África y America Latina. Es nuestro tumo de tomar aquella antorcha. En COMIBAM 87, como iberoamericanos, estamos tomando aquella antorcha y diciendo si al Señor: &quot;Señor, estamos dispuestos a ser tu siervo, tu instrumento para llevar aquella antorcha y ser luz para las naciones&quot;. 2. ¿Qué significa ser Luz para las Naciones? 2.1 En primer lugar, ser luz significa tener INTEGRIDADPERSONAL, SANTIDAD. En el da que Moises, siervo de Dios, fue llamado, fue atraído a una luz brillante, él se acercó a una luz sobrenatural. Era una zarza que ardía y no se consumía. Allí, en el desierto, escucho las palabras de Dios: &quot;Quita las sandalias de tus pies porque el lugar en que tu estas, tierra santa es.&quot; &quot;Sed santo,&quot; dice Dios a su siervo, &quot;porque Yo soy santo.&quot; Cristo hablo de la integridad personal, de la santidad y la excelencia del carácter moral en Mateo 6:22 cuando dijo: &quot;...todo tu cuerpo estará lleno de luz,&quot; o sea lleno de integridad. Para que tú y yo cumplamos con el mandato del Señor, necesitamos integridad personal y algo más, necesitamos proclamar elevangelio. 2.2 En segundo lugar &quot;ser luz&#39;&#39; significa INSISTENCIA EN LA PROCLAMACION del evangelio de nuestro SeñorJesucristo. Dios equipo a su siervo para ser luz para las naciones: &quot;Y puso en mi boca como espada aguda&quot;. para qué?, para proclamar las buenas nuevas de la salvación hasta lo postrero de la tierra (Isaías 49:2,6). La luz representa la revelación de Dios, la proclama de Dios. Cuando Dios guio a su pueblo por el desierto en camino a la tierra prometida, les alumbro en las noches con una columna de fuego. La luz represento la revelación, la proclama de las buenas nuevas, de la salvación de Dios. El crecimiento de la Iglesia de nuestro Señor Jesucristo siempre ha ocurrido por media de la proclamación. Cuando vino la persecución sabre la Iglesia primitiva en Jerusalén, dice la Sagrada Escritura, que todos fueron esparcidos e iban por todas partes insistentemente anunciando el evangelio y vino avivamiento a Samaria. Así como en tiempos pasados, cumplir con el llamado de ser luz para. las naciones, implica no soIo proclamar el evangelio sino perseverar en la proclama a pesar de la persecución. Hoy día, más de la mitad de los cinco mil millones de personas viviendo en el mundo, se encuentran en países donde los evangélicosson perseguidos. Por ejemplo, tomemos el caso actual de China, país en que viven, casi una cuarta parte de la población del mundo. A pesar de la terrible persecución de los evangélicos en la China desde 1949, los que sobrevivieron, insistentemente testificaron y predicaron de su fe en Cristo. La Iglesia del Señor en este pais ha crecido más dramáticamente que en cualquier otro lugar y tiempo de la historia, por el testimonio de misioneros chinos quienes fueron a otros pueblos, cruzando fronteras culturales, lingüísticas, étnicas y sociales. Fueron esparcidos por toda China, penetrando a los más de dos mil grupos de gentes con distintas características culturales. Misioneros que predicaron el evangelio insistentemente en cada lugar donde fueron; y la Iglesia creció de un estimado de un millón de creyentes en 1949 a más de 50 millones hoy dia. La Iglesia creció cincuenta veces en una generación, 5,000%. Y coma dice el Salmista en el 34:5,&quot;Los que miraron a él fueron alumbrados y sus rostros no fueron avergonzados.&quot; &quot;La luz en las tinieblas resplandece y las tinieblas no prevalecieron contra ella.&quot; Cristo dijo: &#39;Vosotrossoisla luz delmundo; una ciudad asentada sabre unmonte no se puede esconder. Ni se enciende una luz y se pone debajo de un almud, sino sabre el candelero, y alumbra a todoslas que están en casa...&quot; Si vamos a ser luz a las naciones, debemos prepararnos para proclamar el evangelio insistentemente, a pesar de todo tipo de persecución. El haber sido dados coma luz para las naciones significa integridad personal e insistente proclama, pero también significa una cosamás... 2.3 En tercer lugar, significa influencia con nuestra presencia. &quot;Serluz&quot; significa para bien influir en la comunidad donde nos encontramos. influir en las sociedades de una manerapositiva y en el cursomismode la historia secular, para elsimple hechodenuestrapresencia.Tiene que ver con las buenas obras. Cristo dijo: &#39;Vosotros sois la luz del mundo... Así alumbren vuestra luz delante de los hombres, para que vean vuestras buenas obras y glorifiquen a vuestro Padre que está en los cielos.&quot; Es para que tú y yo colaboremos para bien en la vida económica, política y social de las naciones. Contribuyamos en hospitales, clínicas, otros; y nos interesemos par nuestras vecindades, para las marginadas,paralaspobres, paralasviudas,paralashuérfanas, otros. Israel, el Pueblo de Dios en el pasado, fue dado para ser luz para las naciones. días le dio la promesa: &quot;Andarán las naciones a tu luz...&quot; (Is. 60:3). Par su influencia fue visitada por la reina de Saba quien, al contemplar a Israel, pueblo de días y Salomón su Rey, dijo: &quot;ni aun se me dijo la mitad; es mayor tu sabiduría y bien...&quot; Pablo y Bernabé alsalir como misioneros a las naciones en su primer viaje misionero (Hebreos. 13:47), citanlaspalabrasdeIsaías49:6:&quot;Porqueasínoshamandadoel Señor, diciendo:Tehepuestoparaluzde losgentiles,afindequeseasparasalvaciónhastalo último de latierra.&quot; Que nuestra presencia en las naciones sirva para influir para bien. &quot;Así alumbra vuestra luz delante de los hombres,para que vean vuestrasbuenasobras y glorifiquen a vuestro Padre que está en los cielos.&quot; Nos corresponde ser luz, demostrando integridad personal, con insistente proclama e influyendo con nuestra presencia. ¿Pero surge la inquietud, donde? 3. ¿Dónde debemosserluz? Son dos descripciones enfocando el lugar donde cumplir con el mandato en nuestro texto lema de Isaías 49:6:Dice &quot;te diporluzde lasnaciones,&quot; &quot;paraque seasmisalvación. hastalopostrerodelatierra.&quot;Primera,menciona&quot;lasnaciones&quot;ysegundo,&quot;lopostrerode la tierra.&quot; La expresión, &quot;las naciones&quot; no se refiere aquí a un pais. Muchos de los países del mundo, especialmente en America Latina y África fueron determinados por unos apoderados de tiempos pasados que tomaron un mapa y trazaron su &quot;raya&quot; humana, dividiéndose suelo y habitantes en el continente entre las coronas de los conquistadores. El mandato &quot;haced discípulos a todas las naciones&quot; y &quot;sed luz a las naciones&quot; se refiere a algo más, y es algo que necesitamos entender bien para cumplir con la tarea encomendada. Desde 1974, especialmente en diversas consultas misiono lógicasse ha ido estudiando el significado de la palabra &quot;naciones&quot; y se ha llegado a entender que eltermino se refiere a grupo afín. Se ha definido como: &quot;Un grupo sociológico de personas suficientemente numeroso, quienes consideran tener alguna afinidad unos conotros. Desde el punto de vistadelaevangelizaciónolatareadeserluzalasnaciones,es el grupo más grande de personas dentro del cual el evangelio puede ser esparcido, sin encontrar barrerasde comprensión oaceptación.&quot; El énfasis de COMIBAMes porlo tanto ir a estasnaciones para serluz. Es un énfasis transcultural, deira otra cultura y penetrar a un grupo distinto en elsentido antropológico o sociologico, sea un grupo social o un grupo étnico. Y en particular, ir a un grupo inalcanzado, a un grupo entre el cual no existe una comunidad de creyentes ni recurses para evangelizar el grupo sin tener ayuda de afuera. El énfasis de COMIBAM es en los grupos no alcanzados del mundo, tanto en los grandes centros urbanos como en las zonasrurales, dentro como fuera del continente latinoamericano. El Atlas y el libro Reto iberoamericano que fueron entregados a ustedes para este congreso, son un intento de identificar algunas de las naciones que constituyen un desafío especial para nosotros tanto dentrodelcontinentelatinoamericanocomoporfuera. Una carta que recibí en cuanto al proceso de COMIBAM expone la inquietud de que hemos olvidado nuestra Judeay Samaria. No es así, esparte delreto de lasnaciones, de irmas allá. Dice eltextolemaIsaías 49:6, que seamosluz hasta lo postrero de la tierra. Necesitamosfijar en el último extreme de la tierra, paramisionarallá también. De allí se desprende otra preocupación expresada por muchos. ¿Como puede la Iglesia iberoamericana en memento y hora histórica de tanta crisis, económica y social, contemplar el envío de misioneros? Estonosllevaalacuartainterrogante ... 4. ¿Cuándo serluz para las naciones? La respuesta es clara. Isaías 49:5 comienza con las palabras: &quot;Ahora pues...&quot; Como Pablo dice: &#39;&#39;Ya es hora de despertamos del sueño...&quot; Cuando Dios llama y dice &quot;Tu eres mi siervo, te he puesto como saeta bruñida...&quot;, solo se puede contestar, &quot;SI Señor.&quot; Hoy es el dia para la Iglesia iberoamericana de levantarse y tomarla antorcha para llevarlaluz a las naciones. Ahora es el memento. Recuerdo lo que dijeron los hermanos&#39; bolivianos en la Consulta celebrada en Bolivia: &quot;Esta vision es un eco de lo que Dios ya nos ha dado.&quot; También las palabras de los hermanos en Chile al expresar: &quot;Esla hora para que la Iglesia Latinoamericana ponga su grano de arena en la causa de la evangelización del mundo.&quot; Y la llamada telefónica desde la Republica Dominicana que decía: &quot;Nosotros, delegados a COMIBAM, vamos conganasporquecreemosqueesteeselmementoparaAmericaLatina&quot;. Elhechode que cada paisiberoamericano ha enviado una buena delegación, que en la mayoría de los cases es mucho más de lo esperado, muestra que Dios ha estado confirmando entre su pueblo iberoamericano que es la hora de cumplir con el llamado a ser luz para las naciones. Los llamados a la evangelización del mundo vienen en mementos de debilidad humana para que Diosse glorifique. Hoy es eltiempo de Iberoamérica, aunque sea tiempo de crisis económica. Es asunto de fe. Así comoAbrahamfue obediente al llamado de días, concasi100anosdeedad,sucuerpodébil,suesposa estéril, y sin el cumplimiento de la promesa de comenzar el linaje a través del cual vendrá aquel que sería bendición a todas lasfamilias de la tierra. Nosotrostambién debemos estar plenamente convencidos de que &quot;... era también poderoso para hacertodo lo que había prometido.&quot; Como dice Pablo en Romanos 4es Diosquienllamalascosasquenosoncomasifuesen. Esasuntode esperanza contraesperanza. Los discípulostambién estaban en crisis económica en el principio del libro de los Hechos, cuando fueron comisionados a sertestigoshasta loúltimode latierra. Es que las misiones no dependen del poder político ni económico si no de la obediencia y fe en la Palabra deDios. Hoy es el dia para la Iglesia Latinoamericana: tomar aquella antorcha, convertirse de un campo misioneroaunafuerzamisioneraparalagloriadedías. Lapreguntaesporque debemos hacerlo. 5. ¿Porqué serluz para las naciones? La primera razón de ser luz es porque Dios así lo demanda. Isaías 49:6 en Español dice: &quot;...tu seas ... luz para las naciones.&quot; Israel, como pueblo de Dios, había prostituido el propósito de Dios para ellos. Es de poca importanciapara Dios, esalgoliviano,esalgasecundariaquelevanteslastribusdeJacob y restaures elremanente de Israel. Estaban preocupados por ellos mismos y era bueno, pero secundario. Eran nacionalistas, interesados en sus pueblos, en sus tribus y en su remanente. · Estaba bien ser nacionalistas, preocupados per su propiopais. Pero existe algo aún más importante en lamente deDios que esserluz para las naciones. El llamamientomásgrandequetiene elsiervo de Dios es elde preocuparseper otros pueblos. Cristolodijodeestamanera:&#39;Todoelquequierasalvarsuvida,laperderá;ytodoelque pierdasuvidapor causa demí, este la salvara.&quot; Si buscassalvartu vida la perderás, pero si pierdestu vida por causa de mí y el evangelio la salvaras. ¡Quieres ser bendecido y que tu tierra sea restaurada? Quieres tener vida. abundante? Yo quiero que seas luz para las naciones, dice Jehová de los Ejércitos. Dios habrá bendecido a Israel, redimiéndole de la esclavitud y llevándole a una tierra abundante dondefluíalecheymiel.ParaIsrael, comomuestradegratitudaDios porlo que El habíahecho, erapoco cumplir conloque Dios deseabapara ellos:serluzpara las naciones.Sinembargo,ellosnolohicieron.Eso mismo,anhelaDiosparasuIglesiaen Iberoamérica. El Señor ha hecho tanto por nosotros, su pueblo en Iberoamérica: nos ha salvado, comprándonos con lo que tiene más valor que oro y plata, la sangre de Jesucristo. La segunda razón porque debemos ser luz a las naciones es por la necesidad del mundo en que vivimos; necesidad en todos sentidos. 75% de los incrédulos del mundo viven entre pueblos inalcanzados, donde solo se puede llegar con un trabajo &quot;secular&quot;. Necesitan de todo el evangelio, tanto presencia de buenas obras como de proclama clara del mensaje redentor. Si no vamos a las naciones, otros irán para hacer el trabajo transcultural. La Biblia es clara, en aquel dia, delante del trono y en la presencia del Cordero, habrá personas vestidas de ropas blancas de todas naciones, tribus, pueblos y lenguas. Si nosotros no vamos, otros si irán. Como pueblos del Señor de habla española y portuguesa. pongamos nuestro grano de arena para la causa de la evangelización del mundo. ¿La gran pregunta es Como? Estamos convencidos que hay que hacerlo; ¿la cuestión es 1, como hacerlo? 6. ¿Como serluz para las naciones? Nos hemos reunido para responder esta pregunta. Por eso estamos aquí esta semana. Por esa razón, se ha invertido tanto esfuerzo, recurso y dinero para reunimos en COMIBAM 87. Para consultar con días, con su Palabra y los unos a los otros como es que las iglesias evangélicas iberoamericanas pueden cumplir con la comisión que nuestro Señor nos ha dado de ser luz para las naciones. Busquemos la respuesta a esa pregunta en Dios y su Palabra, a través de la hora bíblica cada dia, por media de las nueve plenarias que trazan como un hilo el como del mandate de Cristo, por los 80 semanarios; por media de las consultas en los mini-grupos por afinidad y en las reuniones por países. ¡Como implementar la vision de ser luz para las naciones? ¡Que prioridades tenemos que modificar en nuestra vida y ministerio?, ¿Qué cambios de mentalidad de ser receptora a ser enviadora del evangelio?, ¿qué actividades debemos ajustar?, ¿qué programas tenemos que variar en la escuela dominical, sociedad juvenil, femenil, de caballeros, en la iglesia, en nuestra denominación, entidad de servicio cristiano, instituto bíblico, y seminario? ¿Qué nuevas estructuras tenemos que crear? ¿Asociación de iglesias iberoamericanas promisionesmundiales? ¿Centros nacionales de misiones mundiales? ¿Asociación de creyentes comprometidos con misionestransculturales? ¿Una federación o asociación de agencias misioneras? ¿Una asociación de investigadores para continuar la investigación del campo misionero y la fuerza misionera? ¿Una federación de profesores de misiones? ¿Asociaciones juveniles, femeniles o decaballeros? ¿Pues no es este nuestro propósito de ser luz para las naciones? Conclusión: El campoeselmundo,unmundodeciudades,unmundodegruposétnicos,unmundo de universitarios, un mundo de marginados, un mundo árabe musulmán, un mundo de países necesitados espiritualmente, España, Portugal, Italia, Grecia, Angola, Mozambique, Filipinas, India, China, otros. El llamado de días es de ser luz en este mundo, a las naciones. Nos llama coma su pueblo, jóvenes, señoritas, damas, caballeros, hombres de negocio, profesionales, médicos, pastores, lideres denominacionales,líderesdeentidadesdeserviciocristiano. Tomemos en serio sullamada. Oigamossuvoz. La tareaes demasiado grande parauna denominaciónouna entidad cristiana. Compartamos nuestras ideas. Participemostodos.

    "title": "8 Principles of World Evangelization by the Year 2000",
    "content": "Eight Principles for World Evangelization by the Year 2000 Luis Bush When we contemplate the challenge of world evangelization by the year 2000 we often think in terms of plans and, strategies and projects. Thomas Wang, International Director for the Lausanne Committee was telling me that up to now at least 400 plans for world evangelization by the year 2000 have been presented. Perhaps more than one more plan or project we need to step back and consider the principles that could result in world evangelization by the year 2000. Thomas Wang asked me to share this with the readers of the Lausanne Communique which I am grateful to do. As I have worked closely with the COMIBAM movement over the last three years these principles have emerged as crucial in that kind of a vision. In addition, these principles are demonstrated in what I perceive as the greatest movement of God&#39;s people at any time in history as recorded in the Word of God, commonly known as the Exodus. 1. The principle of Spiritual Movement. Someone has said that history is really His story. As God has sovereignly worked throughout human history what is noteworthy is that history is a series of movements, rather than of isolated events. Effects can be traced to causes, events to precursors. One of the most astounding events in all of history is the Exodus, when God called His People that were by that time over one million strong, out of a situation of the worst kind of bondage in the grip of a tyrant and moved them over a forty year period through a desert to an abundant land to fulfill it&#39;s calling as His Servant to bring light to the nations. It was a divinely initiated movement. (Ex. 3) It involved human instrumentation that by a ripple effect of commitment to the vision finally encompassed all of God&#39;s people who caught the vision and obeyed the call. As we think of God&#39;s people today they are not in one physical location as at the time of the Exodus, but yet the same movement can take place as the Body of Christ in different regions of the world can identify with the common vision of world evangelization by the year 2000. It seems to me that we cannot expect the world to be evangelized by the year 2000 unless the Body of Christ in every region of the world is mobilized and responds to the call. The principle of cooperating with what the Spirit of God is doing in a spiritual movement, rather than setting up a human plan or strategy is a vital one. Someone paraphrased Zacharias 4 with significant response by the participants at COMIBAM this way: &quot;&#39;It&#39;s not by computers, nor by dollars but by My Spirit, &#39; says the Lord.&quot; Maybe we should say that it is by computers and by dollars but more than anything else it must be by God&#39;s Spirit. Unless we break into a movement of the Spirit of God, any effort and strategy to evangelize the world by the year 2000 is doomed to failure. In explaining rebirth to Nicodemus Jesus made the statement in John 3, &quot;Just as the wind bloweth where it wills so the spirit bloweth where it wills.&quot; We need to listen to the rustling of the leaves and discern where and how the Spirit is moving and then put up the sail and expect our ship called &quot;World Evangelization by the Year 2000&quot; to move ahead. To evangelize the world by the year 2000 we must recognize the fact that over the last twenty five years, the Spirit of God has been moving in a remarkable way among the peoples of Asia, Africa and Latin America. According to the latest edition of Operation World by Patrick Johnstone, whereas in 1900, nine percent of evangelical Christians came from the Third World, in 1985 sixty six percent of evangelical Christians live in the Third World. History shows that with every major movement of the Spirit of God there is a consequential interest in world evangelization. Acts 1:8 affirms that any major initiative in world missions must be preceded by a spiritual revival and renewal in the church. The church must grasp the fullness of the power of the Spirit of God before expecting to launch out in a fresh outreach. There is a definite cause-effect relationship between the increased activity of the Spirit of God in the Church and the outreach to the world. This is suggested by the increased participation in missions by the younger churches. In the recent booklet on the Lausanne Story, when reviewing the 1974 Congress which Time magazine called &quot;a formidable forum, probably the widest ranging meeting of Christians ever held,&quot; the writers suggest that perhaps the single most important outcome of this congress was the fifteen point Lausanne Covenant. In paragraph eight of this document, titled Churches in Evangelistic Partnership, it reads: We rejoice that a new missionary era has dawned. The dominant role of Western missions is fast disappearing. God is raising up from the younger churches a new resource for world evangelization, and is thus demonstrating that the responsibility to evangelize belongs to the whole body of Christ. This October, at the fourth triennial conference of the Asian Missions Association (AMA), it was reported that there were 10,210 Asian missionaries in 1985 and that at the present rate of growth of 15.4% per year; there will be 67,000 Asian missionaries by the year 2000 A.D. In Latin America at the recent COMIBAM Conference the great interest in world evangelization was clearly evident by the sacrificial and determined involvement in the Conference by the Body of Christ from 26 countries in Latin America. As an example, the Chilean delegation spent 120 hours traveling by land to come one way across the mighty Cordillera Andes Range with 250 participants from throughout Chile. For most of the Latin American countries it was the largest delegation ever to attend a Christian Conference even though there were a number of requirements for attendance including involvement in a discipleship intercessory groups, written approval by the pastor and national leaders and payment of two-thirds of the travel costs. The atmosphere of Celebration of the Lord and unity behind the vision was evident throughout the Conference. Most countries have planned regional and national follow-up consultations and conferences to continue to spread the vision. In Africa, Tokunboh Adeyemo, General Secretary of AEAM, along with Panya Babba who leads the largest single emerging mission’s agency have called for the Mobilizing of Africa for missions at the ICOM Conference in Nigeria in August, 1985 and at the recent AEAM Assembly. 2. The principle of indigenization. For the world to be evangelized by the year 2000, the vision must be owned by the Body of Christ in every continent of the world. It must become the vision of the Church in that part of the World. Rather than one more imported idea brought into the Body of Christ in a country, it must be a vision that emerges out of the Body of Christ in a country. For example, in the development of COMIBAM it was soon found that the terms normally used in the process of world evangelization had completely different meanings to what someone outside of Latin America would understand. For, example, to the evangelical believers living in Ecuador, a missionary meant anyone who worked at HCJB Radio Station, whether a foreigner or a national from that country. It was necessary, therefore, to redeem the meaning of some of these terms, to redefine others or to use different words to express the meaning intended. We discovered that language is a powerful vehicle of expression that can either increase understanding or bring confusion. Consequently, over a two-year span, a number of huddles and meetings were held in different locations with different participants to come to grips with the meaning of concepts and terms so that a standardized usage could emerge. Finally, a more definitive continent-wide consultation was held in June 1985 in Antigua, Guatemala to seek to define the key terms of missions. Aside from the terminology and fresh definition of the task in the language and the context of evangelical believers in that part of the world, it was recognized that the methods and models for world evangelization should where possible emerge from the context of the church. These new methods and models were documented and published and distributed the church in other parts of Iberoamerica. This conviction was expressed at Antigua as follows: &quot;On the eve of the third millennium, we must take into account the changing reality and the new challenges and opportunities to fulfill our missionary task in the Third World. Therefore, we have the responsibility to develop a new concept and a new methodology of missions which responds to this changing reality. We should not necessarily think in the same terms and with the same mentality of past generations.&quot; An effective way for the vision of World Evangelization by the Year 2000 to become effective and to be owned by the Body of Christ is every country of the World is through the process of National Consultations. 3. The principle of consultation of the Body of Christ is an essential aspect to World Evangelization by the Year 2000. Returning to the account of the movement of God&#39;s People at the time of the Exodus, prior to the charge to Pharaoh to let God&#39;s people go, Moses consulted the elders and also spoke to God&#39;s people. Moses received the vision from God and then consulted with God&#39;s people. It became a grass roots vision. It was owned by every one of God&#39;s people who in preparation of the tenth sign, followed the procedure of covering the entrances of their homes with blood spilt from the sacrifice of a one-year lamb without defect and then remained inside the house during that night. In the COMIBAM process one of the key aspects that resulted in the involvement of the Body of Christ from each of the Iberoamerican countries was the process of holding national consultations on world evangelization. This is the principle of inquiry of God’s people. Several times the question was asked what the difference between a consultations and a congress is. In the consultation, Church leaders would be asked as to their history, knowledge, interest, models and involvement in world evangelization, in the congress, a vision was brought to the participants who were normally pastors and youth leaders. The posture at the consultation was one of listening, at the Congresses one of speaking. The objectives for consultation were to encourage one another through reports about the world movement of the Holy Spirit, to review the participation of the national church in mission efforts so far, to highlight the extent of the remaining task within the country, to consider how to involve the churches of the country more actively in the task of world evangelization, to document the missiological efforts so far. The procedure was to ask representatives of denominations, local churches and Christian service organizations to bring short reports on the history of the gospel with their organization, the world evangelization efforts so far. In the process it was beautiful to observe the barriers between organizations and denominations begin to crumble and in some cases accompanied by open confession and healing of the Body of Christ in that country. Another result of the consultation was often a significantly increased awareness by the national leaders as to their need to become more actively involved in world evangelization. 4. The principle of involvement of every major element within the Body of Christ. World evangelization by the year 2000 is an all-encompassing task. It requires the participation of pastors, it needs the commitment of young people, and it requires the women, the professionals and lay people, the denominational leaders, the leaders of para-church organizations, mission agency executives, and theological educators. One of the most important aspects of involvement by affinity is discipleship groups where the purpose of gathering is to become world Christians. A number of people felt that this was the most vital of all aspects of the COMIBAM movement. Materials were specially prepared for intercession in discipleship groups that met weekly and all participants within the COMIBAM process were encouraged to participate in one of these discipleship groups for at least 13 weeks to become eligible to attend the conference. Many began their own groups, and the long-term missions awareness and commitment to world evangelization probably came out of these groups more than any other means. One of the significant focuses in our discussion by affinity groups at COMIBAM was the triangle made of mission agencies, local churches and theological training instructions. We need to build bridges to involve every element of the Body of Christ in the common goal of world evangelization if we are to accomplish the task by the year 2000. There are many different kinds of affinity groups within the Body of Christ, as the task is taken up and discussed within the separate affinity groups and then together as a whole there is increasing ownership of the vision. At the COMIBAM Conference during the course of the week there were in essence 37 mini-consultations that met at least twice for a minimum of three hours. 26 of these were country consultations to discuss what parts of the developing vision they wished to implement in their own countries and how best to implement the vision. In the affinity group session by affinity group such as young people, models were presented and discussed in small groups and the matter of implementation of the vision within that particular affinity group considered and an affirmation of the vision of the affinity group within the vision. These affirmations were gathered together and integrated into the COMIBAM affirmation. 5. The principle of research of the harvest field and the harvest force. For world evangelization by the year 2000 it is absolutely essential to understand the nature of the remaining task and the harvest force which will be involved in accomplishing the task. This can only be done with carefully coordinated research effort that will provide as clear and comprehensible a picture of what is involved so that any person in the Body of Christ can have access to the information and understand how to use it when he gets it into his hands. With the technological advances and breakthroughs in mapping techniques that the Global Mapping Project have been able to make as well as the intensive long-term, careful efforts that produced the World Christian Encyclopedia by David Barrett and Operation World by Patrick Johnstone, with the participation of national and foreign researchers focusing on the unreached urban and rural centers of the world we are in a most favorable position of visualizing the task with the production of regional Atlases reflecting past, present and future obtainable information in the simplest possible way to bring the facts to bear and light to the task of world evangelization. 6. The principle of cooperation. The task of World Evangelization by the year 2000 is too great for any one single organization or denomination to adopt as its own. It&#39;s a task worthy of and requiring the active participation of the entire Body of Christ. Whether local church, denomination, or Christian organization, it is something we can all cooperate together in and in this we will be glorifying God. It is also too much of a task for either traditional missions or emerging missions or western Missions versus non-western missions. When there is cooperation the potential is enormous. When Jesus called his disciples to the task of worldwide witnessing in his last words uttered prior to His ascension, he singled out the enormous power packed into the witnesses when he used the word from which we get &quot;dynamite,&quot; when He said You shall receive power, dunamis, when the Holy Spirit comes upon you, therefore go. Emerging missions is a tremendous, power-packed new wave and third force that could penetrate the last vestiges of enemy stronghold. But the experience and resources of western and traditional missions is absolutely necessary to come alongside this new wave if we are to accomplish the task of world evangelization by the year 2000. We are in a new age of partnership in mission. Partnership between western and non-western missions is one of the great challenges of our day as we approach the year 2000. It is neither a relationship of dependence or independence but interdependence that needs to be fostered, working together in researching, training, motivating church leaders in developing strategy to plant the church among the unreached peoples in cities and villages throughout the world. It’s time to join forces on the basis of equality and respect for one another to fulfill the mandate our great Lord and Savior Jesus Christ entrusted to us. Together we can. 7. The principle of encouragement. One of the reasons I believe that COMIBAM took place was the encouragement of different members of the Body of Christ. At the very beginning of the process in early 1985, letters were mailed out tentatively describing the vision to 200 Christian leaders in many different countries of the world. The great encouragement received then and since in different ways has been one of the main reasons for the enduring of the project. When Moses first received the vision for mobilizing God&#39;s His people into action to be all that God had intended for them to be, his first contact was with his brother Aaron. Just suppose for a moment that Aaron had responded very negatively to the vision, &quot;Impossible&quot; he could have said, and humanly speaking, he may have been right from his perspective at the time. Instead, Aaron greatly encouraged Moses and shared the vision of all that God had spoken to his brother, (Ex. 4:28). We need to encourage one another in the vision God is giving to so many in the Body of Christ for world evangelization by the year 2000. To overcome the enormous obstacles that we will be confronting to accomplish this vision, we must encourage one another. Even if, like Aaron, you yourself did not receive the vision directly from the Lord, the Great Commission is clear enough for all of us to buy into. 8. The principle of a major event focal point. As you read the account of the mobilization of God&#39;s people in the Exodus from Egypt when so many moved out at the same time to meet with their God for worship and instruction, it becomes clear that the movement did not begin with the event but rather preceded it. But what caused the movement was the focus on the event of the Exodus. God had said to Moses: &quot;I will remove &#39;My people&#39; from the affliction of Egypt to ... a land flowing with milk and honey.&quot; (Ex. 3:17) Yet form the time the vision was given to its fulfillment are many chapters of the Scriptures and much time. Yet the vision generated momentum that resulted in a movement. Many obstacles of enormous human proportions had to be overcome. The movement carried God&#39;s people over these obstacles like an enormous wave swallows all in its path. In the same way there needs to be a major event focal point for the mobilization of God&#39;s people. The year 2000 presents a major goal for the accomplishment of the task, but a previous date needs to be set which will become the focal point as in the Exodus for the major united mobilization of the entire Body of Christ. This can be accomplished by breaking the task into Regions of the World, such as Africa, Asia, Latin America, Oceania, Europe, North Africa and the Middle East, and North America. Within each region a major focal point can be established for the clarification of the commission of world evangelization by the Year 2000, following a process of consultations nationally and/or regionally within a country, a documentation of the harvest field and harvest force, the challenge of world evangelization by the year 2000 for that region of the world and effective models of how that work is being done. ICOWE II could be an occasion to call the Body of Christ to the vision and a subsequent world level gathering on a smaller scale with the Hudson Taylor&#39;s, William Carey&#39;s and John Mott&#39;s of the world in that day who will be those God is using to mobilize the Church in their region of the world. This second gathering would discuss the matter of implementation of the vision of world evangelization by the year 2000, following the regional gatherings and could be held five years after ICOWE II, in 1994. The last five years of the century the expectation would be that the entire Body of Christ, in every region of the world, would own the vision and become actively involved in accomplishing the task of World Evangelization by the Year 2000.

    "content": "Primera Consulta Misiologica pro COMIBAM &#39;87 LA MISIÓN DE LA IGLESIA Y LAS MISIONES MUNDIALES Primera Consulta Teológica Iberoamericana Antigua, Guatemala 8 2 al 4 de junio de 1986 La Primera Consulta Teológica Iberoamericana sobre “La misión de la iglesia y las misiones mundiales”, auspiciada por COMIBAM (Congreso Misionero Iberoamericano) surgió cuando vimos la necesidad que se presentaba de continuar redefiniendo la terminología sobre misiones con bases bíblico8teológicas. Al definir los términos no sólo hemos pensado en COMIBAM como proceso, sino en toda la iglesia latinoamericana y de otros continentes. Esta Consulta se realizó en la ciudad de Antigua, Guatemala, del 2 al 4 de junio de 1986, con la asistencia de dieciocho delegados de siete países latinoamericanos, todos sintiendo la carga enorme de la responsabilidad misionera de la iglesia. La grandeza de la tarea nos hace permanecer humildes; sin embargo, hemos querido expresarnos teológicamente para contribuir al desarrollo de la conciencia misionera de la iglesia. Sentimos que es urgente y necesario definir con claridad la misión de la iglesia y las misiones mundiales, para participación plena de la iglesia iberoamericana. Reconocemos la necesidad de la reflexión como base para nuestra acción. Es nuestro deseo de que este documento contribuya a orientar y acelerar el despertar misionero que nuestro continente está experimentando. Desde los inicios de COMIBAM, la definición de terminología misionera ha sido uno de los aspectos más importantes, de manera tal que en una reunión previa llevada a cabo en México, en diciembre de 1984, se reflexionó sobre la necesidad de clarificar la terminología a emplearse. Para la organización de esta Primera Consulta se llevaron a cabo varios encuentros preparatorios, acompañados de una evaluación de conceptos, por correspondencia, con misiólogos, pastores y líderes cristianos de cuatro continentes. Durante el desarrollo de la Consulta usamos de la siguiente metodología: cada orador, que había hecho circular previamente su ponencia por escrito, se refirió sintéticamente a la misma, luego de lo cual fue discutida ampliamente para arribar a posibles conclusiones. Estas fueron luego entregadas a un Comité de Redacción para su revisión. Al final del evento, el documento fue expuesto al plenario para sudiscusión y aprobación.
